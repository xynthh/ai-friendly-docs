(From interceptors.md)

## Interceptors

`HttpClient` supports a form of middleware known as _interceptors_.

TLDR: Interceptors are middleware that allows common patterns around retrying, caching, logging, and authentication to be abstracted away from individual requests.

`HttpClient` supports two kinds of interceptors: functional and DI-based. Our recommendation is to use functional interceptors because they have more predictable behavior, especially in complex setups. Our examples in this guide use functional interceptors, and we cover [DI-based interceptors](#di-based-interceptors) in their own section at the end.

### Interceptors

Interceptors are generally functions which you can run for each request, and have broad capabilities to affect the contents and overall flow of requests and responses. You can install multiple interceptors, which form an interceptor chain where each interceptor processes the request or response before forwarding it to the next interceptor in the chain.

You can use interceptors to implement a variety of common patterns, such as:

* Adding authentication headers to outgoing requests to a particular API.
* Retrying failed requests with exponential backoff.
* Caching responses for a period of time, or until invalidated by mutations.
* Customizing the parsing of responses.
* Measuring server response times and log them.
* Driving UI elements such as a loading spinner while network operations are in progress.
* Collecting and batch requests made within a certain timeframe.
* Automatically failing requests after a configurable deadline or timeout.
* Regularly polling the server and refreshing results.

### Defining an interceptor

The basic form of an interceptor is a function which receives the outgoing `HttpRequest` and a `next` function representing the next processing step in the interceptor chain.

For example, this `loggingInterceptor` will log the outgoing request URL to `console.log` before forwarding the request:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function loggingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  console.log(req.url);
  return next(req);
}
</docs-code>

In order for this interceptor to actually intercept requests, you must configure `HttpClient` to use it.

### Configuring interceptors

You declare the set of interceptors to use when configuring `HttpClient` through dependency injection, by using the `withInterceptors` feature:

<docs-code language="ts">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    withInterceptors([loggingInterceptor, cachingInterceptor]),
  )
]});
</docs-code>

The interceptors you configure are chained together in the order that you've listed them in the providers. In the above example, the `loggingInterceptor` would process the request and then forward it to the `cachingInterceptor`.

#### Intercepting response events

An interceptor may transform the `Observable` stream of `HttpEvent`s returned by `next` in order to access or manipulate the response. Because this stream includes all response events, inspecting the `.type` of each event may be necessary in order to identify the final response object.

<docs-code language="ts">
export function loggingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  return next(req).pipe(tap(event => {
    if (event.type === HttpEventType.Response) {
      console.log(req.url, 'returned a response with status', event.status);
    }
  }));
}
</docs-code>

TIP: Interceptors naturally associate responses with their outgoing requests, because they transform the response stream in a closure that captures the request object.

### Modifying requests

Most aspects of `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` instances are _immutable_, and interceptors cannot directly modify them. Instead, interceptors apply mutations by cloning these objects using the `.clone()` operation, and specifying which properties should be mutated in the new instance. This might involve performing immutable updates on the value itself (like `HttpHeaders` or `HttpParams`).

For example, to add a header to a request:

<docs-code language="ts">
const reqWithHeader = req.clone({
  headers: req.headers.set('X-New-Header', 'new header value'),
});
</docs-code>

This immutability allows most interceptors to be idempotent if the same `HttpRequest` is submitted to the interceptor chain multiple times. This can happen for a few reasons, including when a request is retried after failure.

CRITICAL: The body of a request or response is **not** protected from deep mutations. If an interceptor must mutate the body, take care to handle running multiple times on the same request.

### Dependency injection in interceptors

Interceptors are run in the _injection context_ of the injector which registered them, and can use  Angular's `inject` API to retrieve dependencies.

For example, suppose an application has a service called `AuthService`, which creates authentication tokens for outgoing requests. An interceptor can inject and use this service:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function authInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn) {
  // Inject the current `AuthService` and use it to get an authentication token:
  const authToken = inject(AuthService).getAuthToken();

  // Clone the request to add the authentication header.
  const newReq = req.clone({
    headers: req.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', authToken),
  });
  return next(newReq);
}
</docs-code>

### Request and response metadata

Often it's useful to include information in a request that's not sent to the backend, but is specifically meant for interceptors. `HttpRequest`s have a `.context` object which stores this kind of metadata as an instance of `HttpContext`. This object functions as a typed map, with keys of type `HttpContextToken`.

To illustrate how this system works, let's use metadata to control whether a caching interceptor is enabled for a given request.

#### Defining context tokens

To store whether the caching interceptor should cache a particular request in that request's `.context` map, define a new `HttpContextToken` to act as a key:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const CACHING_ENABLED = new HttpContextToken<boolean>(() => true);
</docs-code>

The provided function creates the default value for the token for requests that haven't explicitly set a value for it. Using a function ensures that if the token's value is an object or array, each request gets its own instance.

#### Reading the token in an interceptor

An interceptor can then read the token and choose to apply caching logic or not based on its value:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function cachingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  if (req.context.get(CACHING_ENABLED)) {
    // apply caching logic
    return ...;
  } else {
    // caching has been disabled for this request
    return next(req);
  }
}
</docs-code>

#### Setting context tokens when making a request

When making a request via the `HttpClient` API, you can provide values for `HttpContextToken`s:

<docs-code language="ts">
const data$ = http.get('/sensitive/data', {
  context: new HttpContext().set(CACHING_ENABLED, false),
});
</docs-code>

Interceptors can read these values from the `HttpContext` of the request.

#### The request context is mutable

Unlike other properties of `HttpRequest`s, the associated `HttpContext` is _mutable_. If an interceptor changes the context of a request that is later retried, the same interceptor will observe the context mutation when it runs again. This is useful for passing state across multiple retries if needed.

### Synthetic responses

Most interceptors will simply invoke the `next` handler while transforming either the request or the response, but this is not strictly a requirement. This section discusses several of the ways in which an interceptor may incorporate more advanced behavior.

Interceptors are not required to invoke `next`. They may instead choose to construct responses through some other mechanism, such as from a cache or by sending the request through an alternate mechanism.

Constructing a response is possible using the `HttpResponse` constructor:

<docs-code language="ts">
const resp = new HttpResponse({
  body: 'response body',
});
</docs-code>

### DI-based interceptors

`HttpClient` also supports interceptors which are defined as injectable classes and configured through the DI system. The capabilities of DI-based interceptors are identical to those of functional interceptors, but the configuration mechanism is different.

A DI-based interceptor is an injectable class which implements the `HttpInterceptor` interface:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, handler: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    console.log('Request URL: ' + req.url);
    return handler.handle(req);
  }
}
</docs-code>

DI-based interceptors are configured through a dependency injection multi-provider:

<docs-code language="ts">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    // DI-based interceptors must be explicitly enabled.
    withInterceptorsFromDi(),
  ),

  {provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: LoggingInterceptor, multi: true},
]});
</docs-code>

DI-based interceptors run in the order that their providers are registered. In an app with an extensive and hierarchical DI configuration, this order can be very hard to predict.

## Making HTTP requests

`HttpClient` has methods corresponding to the different HTTP verbs used to make requests, both to load data and to apply mutations on the server. Each method returns an [RxJS `Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) which, when subscribed, sends the request and then emits the results when the server responds.

NOTE: `Observable`s created by `HttpClient` may be subscribed any number of times and will make a new backend request for each subscription.

Through an options object passed to the request method, various properties of the request and the returned response type can be adjusted.

### Fetching JSON data

Fetching data from a backend often requires making a GET request using the [`HttpClient.get()`](api/common/http/HttpClient#get) method. This method takes two arguments: the string endpoint URL from which to fetch, and an *optional options* object to configure the request.

For example, to fetch configuration data from a hypothetical API using the `HttpClient.get()` method:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get<Config>('/api/config').subscribe(config => {
  // process the configuration.
});
</docs-code>

Note the generic type argument which specifies that the data returned by the server will be of type `Config`. This argument is optional, and if you omit it then the returned data will have type `Object`.

TIP: When dealing with data of uncertain structure and potential `undefined` or `null` values, consider using the `unknown` type instead of `Object` as the response type.

CRITICAL: The generic type of request methods is a type **assertion** about the data returned by the server. `HttpClient` does not verify that the actual return data matches this type.

### Fetching other types of data

By default, `HttpClient` assumes that servers will return JSON data. When interacting with a non-JSON API, you can tell `HttpClient` what response type to expect and return when making the request. This is done with the `responseType` option.

| **`responseType` value** | **Returned response type** |
| - | - |
| `'json'` (default) | JSON data of the given generic type |
| `'text'` | string data |
| `'arraybuffer'` | [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) containing the raw response bytes |
| `'blob'` | [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob) instance |

For example, you can ask `HttpClient` to download the raw bytes of a `.jpeg` image into an `ArrayBuffer`:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get('/images/dog.jpg', {responseType: 'arraybuffer'}).subscribe(buffer => {
  console.log('The image is ' + buffer.byteLength + ' bytes large');
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="Literal value for `responseType`">
Because the value of `responseType` affects the type returned by `HttpClient`, it must have a literal type and not a `string` type.

This happens automatically if the options object passed to the request method is a literal object, but if you're extracting the request options out into a variable or helper method you might need to explicitly specify it as a literal, such as `responseType: 'text' as const`.
</docs-callout>

### Mutating server state

Server APIs which perform mutations often require making POST requests with a request body specifying the new state or the change to be made.

The [`HttpClient.post()`](api/common/http/HttpClient#post) method behaves similarly to `get()`, and accepts an additional `body` argument before its options:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.post<Config>('/api/config', newConfig).subscribe(config => {
  console.log('Updated config:', config);
});
</docs-code>

Many different types of values can be provided as the request's `body`, and `HttpClient` will serialize them accordingly:

| **`body` type** | **Serialized as** |
| - | - |
| string | Plain text |
| number, boolean, array, or plain object | JSON |
| [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) | raw data from the buffer |
| [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob) | raw data with the `Blob`'s content type |
| [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FormData) | `multipart/form-data` encoded data |
| [`HttpParams`](api/common/http/HttpParams) or [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` formatted string |

IMPORTANT: Remember to `.subscribe()` to mutation request `Observable`s in order to actually fire the request.

### Setting URL parameters

Specify request parameters that should be included in the request URL using the `params` option.

Passing an object literal is the simplest way of configuring URL parameters:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get('/api/config', {
  params: {filter: 'all'},
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

Alternatively, pass an instance of `HttpParams` if you need more control over the construction or serialization of the parameters.

IMPORTANT: Instances of `HttpParams` are _immutable_ and cannot be directly changed. Instead, mutation methods such as `append()` return a new instance of `HttpParams` with the mutation applied.

<docs-code language="ts">
const baseParams = new HttpParams().set('filter', 'all');

http.get('/api/config', {
  params: baseParams.set('details', 'enabled'),
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

You can instantiate `HttpParams` with a custom `HttpParameterCodec` that determines how `HttpClient` will encode the parameters into the URL.

### Setting request headers

Specify request headers that should be included in the request using the `headers` option.

Passing an object literal is the simplest way of configuring request headers:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get('/api/config', {
  headers: {
    'X-Debug-Level': 'verbose',
  }
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

Alternatively, pass an instance of `HttpHeaders` if you need more control over the construction of headers

IMPORTANT: Instances of `HttpHeaders` are _immutable_ and cannot be directly changed. Instead, mutation methods such as `append()` return a new instance of `HttpHeaders` with the mutation applied.

<docs-code language="ts">
const baseHeaders = new HttpHeaders().set('X-Debug-Level', 'minimal');

http.get<Config>('/api/config', {
  headers: baseHeaders.set('X-Debug-Level', 'verbose'),
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

### Interacting with the server response events

For convenience, `HttpClient` by default returns an `Observable` of the data returned by the server (the response body). Occasionally it's desirable to examine the actual response, for example to retrieve specific response headers.

To access the entire response, set the `observe` option to `'response'`:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get<Config>('/api/config', {observe: 'response'}).subscribe(res => {
  console.log('Response status:', res.status);
  console.log('Body:', res.body);
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="Literal value for `observe`">
Because the value of `observe` affects the type returned by `HttpClient`, it must have a literal type and not a `string` type.

This happens automatically if the options object passed to the request method is a literal object, but if you're extracting the request options out into a variable or helper method you might need to explicitly specify it as a literal, such as `observe: 'response' as const`.
</docs-callout>

### Receiving raw progress events

In addition to the response body or response object, `HttpClient` can also return a stream of raw _events_ corresponding to specific moments in the request lifecycle. These events include when the request is sent, when the response header is returned, and when the body is complete. These events can also include _progress events_ which report upload and download status for large request or response bodies.

Progress events are disabled by default (as they have a performance cost) but can be enabled with the `reportProgress` option.

NOTE: The optional `fetch` implementation of `HttpClient` does not report _upload_ progress events.

To observe the event stream, set the `observe` option to `'events'`:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.post('/api/upload', myData, {
  reportProgress: true,
  observe: 'events',
}).subscribe(event => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case HttpEventType.UploadProgress:
      console.log('Uploaded ' + event.loaded + ' out of ' + event.total + ' bytes');
      break;
    case HttpEventType.Response:
      console.log('Finished uploading!');
      break;
  }
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="Literal value for `observe`">
Because the value of `observe` affects the type returned by `HttpClient`, it must have a literal type and not a `string` type.

This happens automatically if the options object passed to the request method is a literal object, but if you're extracting the request options out into a variable or helper method you might need to explicitly specify it as a literal, such as `observe: 'events' as const`.
</docs-callout>

Each `HttpEvent` reported in the event stream has a `type` which distinguishes what the event represents:

| **`type` value** | **Event meaning** |
| - | - |
| `HttpEventType.Sent` | The request has been dispatched to the server |
| `HttpEventType.UploadProgress` | An `HttpUploadProgressEvent` reporting progress on uploading the request body |
| `HttpEventType.ResponseHeader` | The head of the response has been received, including status and headers |
| `HttpEventType.DownloadProgress` | An `HttpDownloadProgressEvent` reporting progress on downloading the response body |
| `HttpEventType.Response` | The entire response has been received, including the response body |
| `HttpEventType.User` | A custom event from an Http interceptor.

### Handling request failure

There are two ways an HTTP request can fail:

* A network or connection error can prevent the request from reaching the backend server.
* The backend can receive the request but fail to process it, and return an error response.

`HttpClient` captures both kinds of errors in an `HttpErrorResponse` which it returns through the `Observable`'s error channel. Network errors have a `status` code of `0` and an `error` which is an instance of [`ProgressEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ProgressEvent). Backend errors have the failing `status` code returned by the backend, and the error response as the `error`. Inspect the response to identify the error's cause and the appropriate action to handle the error.

The [RxJS library](https://rxjs.dev/) offers several operators which can be useful for error handling.

You can use the `catchError` operator to transform an error response into a value for the UI. This value can tell the UI to display an error page or value, and capture the error's cause if necessary.

Sometimes transient errors such as network interruptions can cause a request to fail unexpectedly, and simply retrying the request will allow it to succeed. RxJS provides several *retry* operators which automatically re-subscribe to a failed `Observable` under certain conditions. For example, the `retry()` operator will automatically attempt to re-subscribe a specified number of times.

### Http `Observable`s

Each request method on `HttpClient` constructs and returns an `Observable` of the requested response type. Understanding how these `Observable`s work is important when using `HttpClient`.

`HttpClient` produces what RxJS calls "cold" `Observable`s, meaning that no actual request happens until the `Observable` is subscribed. Only then is the request actually dispatched to the server. Subscribing to the same `Observable` multiple times will trigger multiple backend requests. Each subscription is independent.

TIP: You can think of `HttpClient` `Observable`s as _blueprints_ for actual server requests.

Once subscribed, unsubscribing will abort the in-progress request. This is very useful if the `Observable` is subscribed via the `async` pipe, as it will automatically cancel the request if the user navigates away from the current page. Additionally, if you use the `Observable` with an RxJS combinator like `switchMap`, this cancellation will clean up any stale requests.

Once the response returns, `Observable`s from `HttpClient` usually complete (although interceptors can influence this).

Because of the automatic completion, there is usually no risk of memory leaks if `HttpClient` subscriptions are not cleaned up. However, as with any async operation, we strongly recommend that you clean up subscriptions when the component using them is destroyed, as the subscription callback may otherwise run and encounter errors when it attempts to interact with the destroyed component.

TIP: Using the `async` pipe or the `toSignal` operation to subscribe to `Observable`s ensures that subscriptions are disposed properly.

### Best practices

While `HttpClient` can be injected and used directly from components, generally we recommend you create reusable, injectable services which isolate and encapsulate data access logic. For example, this `UserService` encapsulates the logic to request data for a user by their id:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class UserService {
  private http = inject(HttpClient);

  getUser(id: string): Observable<User> {
    return this.http.get<User>(`/api/user/${id}`);
  }
}
</docs-code>

Within a component, you can combine `@if` with the `async` pipe to render the UI for the data only after it's finished loading:

<docs-code language="ts">
import { AsyncPipe } from '@angular/common';
@Component({
  imports: [AsyncPipe],
  template: `
    @if (user$ | async; as user) {
      <p>Name: {{ user.name }}</p>
      <p>Biography: {{ user.biography }}</p>
    }
  `,
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
  @Input() userId!: string;
  user$!: Observable<User>;

  private userService = inject(UserService);

  constructor(): void {
    this.user$ = this.userService.getUser(this.userId);
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Understanding communicating with backend services using HTTP

Most front-end applications need to communicate with a server over the HTTP protocol, to download or upload data and access other back-end services. Angular provides a client HTTP API for Angular applications, the `HttpClient` service class in `@angular/common/http`.

### HTTP client service features

The HTTP client service offers the following major features:

* The ability to request [typed response values](guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data)
* Streamlined [error handling](guide/http/making-requests#handling-request-failure)
* Request and response [interception](guide/http/interceptors)
* Robust [testing utilities](guide/http/testing)

(From security.md)

## `HttpClient` security

`HttpClient` includes built-in support for two common HTTP security mechanisms: XSSI protection and XSRF/CSRF protection.

TIP: Also consider adopting a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) for your APIs.

### XSSI protection

Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) is a form of [Cross-Site Scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack where an attacker loads JSON data from your API endpoints as `<script>`s on a page they control. Different JavaScript techniques can then be used to access this data.

A common technique to prevent XSSI is to serve JSON responses with a "non-executable prefix", commonly `)]}',\n`. This prefix prevents the JSON response from being interpreted as valid executable JavaScript. When the API is loaded as data, the prefix can be stripped before JSON parsing.

`HttpClient` automatically strips this XSSI prefix (if present) when parsing JSON from a response.

### XSRF/CSRF protection

[Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF or CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is an attack technique by which the attacker can trick an authenticated user into unknowingly executing actions on your website.

`HttpClient` supports a [common mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Cookie-to-header_token) used to prevent XSRF attacks. When performing HTTP requests, an interceptor reads a token from a cookie, by default `XSRF-TOKEN`, and sets it as an HTTP header, `X-XSRF-TOKEN`. Because only code that runs on your domain could read the cookie, the backend can be certain that the HTTP request came from your client application and not an attacker.

By default, an interceptor sends this header on all mutating requests (such as `POST`) to relative URLs, but not on GET/HEAD requests or on requests with an absolute URL.

<docs-callout helpful title="Why not protect GET requests?">
CSRF protection is only needed for requests that can change state on the backend. By their nature, CSRF attacks cross domain boundaries, and the web's [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) will prevent an attacking page from retrieving the results of authenticated GET requests.
</docs-callout>

To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on either the page load or the first GET request. On subsequent requests the server can verify that the cookie matches the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure that only code running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server; this prevents the client from making up its own tokens. Set the token to a digest of your site's authentication cookie with a salt for added security.

To prevent collisions in environments where multiple Angular apps share the same domain or subdomain, give each application a unique cookie name.

<docs-callout important title="HttpClient supports only the client half of the XSRF protection scheme">
  Your backend service must be configured to set the cookie for your page, and to verify that the header is present on all eligible requests. Failing to do so renders Angular's default protection ineffective.
</docs-callout>

#### Configure custom cookie/header names

If your backend service uses different names for the XSRF token cookie or header, use `withXsrfConfiguration` to override the defaults.

Add it to the `provideHttpClient` call as follows:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withXsrfConfiguration({
        cookieName: 'CUSTOM_XSRF_TOKEN',
        headerName: 'X-Custom-Xsrf-Header',
      }),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

#### Disabling XSRF protection

If the built-in XSRF protection mechanism doesn't work for your application, you can disable it using the `withNoXsrfProtection` feature:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withNoXsrfProtection(),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

---


(From setup.md)

## Setting up `HttpClient`

Before you can use `HttpClient` in your app, you must configure it using [dependency injection](guide/di).

### Providing `HttpClient` through dependency injection

`HttpClient` is provided using the `provideHttpClient` helper function, which most apps include in the application `providers` in `app.config.ts`.

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

If your app is using NgModule-based bootstrap instead, you can include `provideHttpClient` in the providers of your app's NgModule:

<docs-code language="ts">
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(),
  ],
  // ... other application configuration
})
export class AppModule {}
</docs-code>

You can then inject the `HttpClient` service as a dependency of your components, services, or other classes:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class ConfigService {
  private http = inject(HttpClient);
  // This service can now make HTTP requests via `this.http`.
}
</docs-code>

### Configuring features of `HttpClient`

`provideHttpClient` accepts a list of optional feature configurations, to enable or configure the behavior of different aspects of the client. This section details the optional features and their usages.

#### `withFetch`

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withFetch(),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

By default, `HttpClient` uses the [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) API to make requests. The `withFetch` feature switches the client to use the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API instead.

`fetch` is a more modern API and is available in a few environments where `XMLHttpRequest` is not supported. It does have a few limitations, such as not producing upload progress events.

#### `withInterceptors(...)`

`withInterceptors` configures the set of interceptor functions which will process requests made through `HttpClient`. See the [interceptor guide](guide/http/interceptors) for more information.

#### `withInterceptorsFromDi()`

`withInterceptorsFromDi` includes the older style of class-based interceptors in the `HttpClient` configuration. See the [interceptor guide](guide/http/interceptors) for more information.

HELPFUL: Functional interceptors (through `withInterceptors`) have more predictable ordering and we recommend them over DI-based interceptors.

#### `withRequestsMadeViaParent()`

By default, when you configure `HttpClient` using `provideHttpClient` within a given injector, this configuration overrides any configuration for `HttpClient` which may be present in the parent injector.

When you add `withRequestsMadeViaParent()`, `HttpClient` is configured to instead pass requests up to the `HttpClient` instance in the parent injector, once they've passed through any configured interceptors at this level. This is useful if you want to _add_ interceptors in a child injector, while still sending the request through the parent injector's interceptors as well.

CRITICAL: You must configure an instance of `HttpClient` above the current injector, or this option is not valid and you'll get a runtime error when you try to use it.

#### `withJsonpSupport()`

Including `withJsonpSupport` enables the `.jsonp()` method on `HttpClient`, which makes a GET request via the [JSONP convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for cross-domain loading of data.

HELPFUL: Prefer using [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to make cross-domain requests instead of JSONP when possible.

#### `withXsrfConfiguration(...)`

Including this option allows for customization of `HttpClient`'s built-in XSRF security functionality. See the [security guide](best-practices/security) for more information.

#### `withNoXsrfProtection()`

Including this option disables `HttpClient`'s built-in XSRF security functionality. See the [security guide](best-practices/security) for more information.

### `HttpClientModule`-based configuration

Some applications may configure `HttpClient` using the older API based on NgModules.

This table lists the NgModules available from `@angular/common/http` and how they relate to the provider configuration functions above.

| **NgModule**                            | `provideHttpClient()` equivalent              |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `HttpClientModule`                      | `provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi())` |
| `HttpClientJsonpModule`                 | `withJsonpSupport()`                          |
| `HttpClientXsrfModule.withOptions(...)` | `withXsrfConfiguration(...)`                  |
| `HttpClientXsrfModule.disable()`        | `withNoXsrfProtection()`                      |

<docs-callout important title="Use caution when using HttpClientModule in multiple injectors">
When `HttpClientModule` is present in multiple injectors, the behavior of interceptors is poorly defined and depends on the exact options and provider/import ordering.

Prefer `provideHttpClient` for multi-injector configurations, as it has more stable behavior. See the `withRequestsMadeViaParent` feature above.

## Test requests

As for any external dependency, you must mock the HTTP backend so your tests can simulate interaction with a remote server. The `@angular/common/http/testing` library provides tools to capture requests made by the application, make assertions about them, and mock the responses to emulate your backend's behavior.

The testing library is designed for a pattern in which the app executes code and makes requests first. The test then expects that certain requests have or have not been made, performs assertions against those requests, and finally provides responses by "flushing" each expected request.

At the end, tests can verify that the app made no unexpected requests.

### Setup for testing

To begin testing usage of `HttpClient`, configure `TestBed` and include `provideHttpClient()` and `provideHttpClientTesting()` in your test's setup. This configures `HttpClient` to use a test backend instead of the real network. It also provides `HttpTestingController`, which you'll use to interact with the test backend, set expectations about which requests have been made, and flush responses to those requests. `HttpTestingController` can be injected from `TestBed` once configured.

Keep in mind to provide `provideHttpClient()` **before** `provideHttpClientTesting()`, as `provideHttpClientTesting()` will overwrite parts of `provideHttpCient()`. Doing it the other way around can potentially break your tests.

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    // ... other test providers
    provideHttpClient(),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
  ],
});

const httpTesting = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);
</docs-code>

Now when your tests make requests, they will hit the testing backend instead of the normal one. You can use `httpTesting` to make assertions about those requests.

### Expecting and answering requests

For example, you can write a test that expects a GET request to occur and provides a mock response:

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    ConfigService,
    provideHttpClient(),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
  ],
});

const httpTesting = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);

// Load `ConfigService` and request the current configuration.
const service = TestBed.inject(ConfigService);
const config$ = this.configService.getConfig<Config>();

// `firstValueFrom` subscribes to the `Observable`, which makes the HTTP request,
// and creates a `Promise` of the response.
const configPromise = firstValueFrom(config$);

// At this point, the request is pending, and we can assert it was made
// via the `HttpTestingController`:
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config', 'Request to load the configuration');

// We can assert various properties of the request if desired.
expect(req.request.method).toBe('GET');

// Flushing the request causes it to complete, delivering the result.
req.flush(DEFAULT_CONFIG);

// We can then assert that the response was successfully delivered by the `ConfigService`:
expect(await configPromise).toEqual(DEFAULT_CONFIG);

// Finally, we can assert that no other requests were made.
httpTesting.verify();
</docs-code>

NOTE: `expectOne` will fail if the test has made more than one request which matches the given criteria.

As an alternative to asserting on `req.method`, you could instead use an expanded form of `expectOne` to also match the request method:

<docs-code language="ts">
const req = httpTesting.expectOne({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/api/config',
}, 'Request to load the configuration');
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: The expectation APIs match against the full URL of requests, including any query parameters.

The last step, verifying that no requests remain outstanding, is common enough for you to move it into an `afterEach()` step:

<docs-code language="ts">
afterEach(() => {
  // Verify that none of the tests make any extra HTTP requests.
  TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController).verify();
});
</docs-code>

### Handling more than one request at once

If you need to respond to duplicate requests in your test, use the `match()` API instead of `expectOne()`. It takes the same arguments but returns an array of matching requests. Once returned, these requests are removed from future matching and you are responsible for flushing and verifying them.

<docs-code language="ts">
const allGetRequests = httpTesting.match({method: 'GET'});
for (const req of allGetRequests) {
  // Handle responding to each request.
}
</docs-code>

### Advanced matching

All matching functions accept a predicate function for custom matching logic:

<docs-code language="ts">
// Look for one request that has a request body.
const requestsWithBody = httpTesting.expectOne(req => req.body !== null);
</docs-code>

The `expectNone` function asserts that no requests match the given criteria.

<docs-code language="ts">
// Assert that no mutation requests have been issued.
httpTesting.expectNone(req => req.method !== 'GET');
</docs-code>

### Testing error handling

You should test your app's responses when HTTP requests fail.

#### Backend errors

To test handling of backend errors (when the server returns a non-successful status code), flush requests with an error response that emulates what your backend would return when a request fails.

<docs-code language="ts">
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config');
req.flush('Failed!', {status: 500, statusText: 'Internal Server Error'});

// Assert that the application successfully handled the backend error.
</docs-code>

#### Network errors

Requests can also fail due to network errors, which surface as `ProgressEvent` errors. These can be delivered with the `error()` method:

<docs-code language="ts">
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config');
req.error(new ProgressEvent('network error!'));

// Assert that the application successfully handled the network error.
</docs-code>

### Testing an Interceptor

You should test that your interceptors work under the desired circumstances.

For example, an application may be required to add an authentication token generated by a service to each outgoing request.
This behavior can be enforced with the use of an interceptor:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function authInterceptor(request: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  const authService = inject(AuthService);

  const clonedRequest = request.clone({
    headers: request.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', authService.getAuthToken()),
  });
  return next(clonedRequest);
}
</docs-code>

The `TestBed` configuration for this interceptor should rely on the `withInterceptors` feature.

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    AuthService,
    // Testing one interceptor at a time is recommended.
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor])),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
  ],
});
</docs-code>

The `HttpTestingController` can retrieve the request instance which can then be inspected to ensure that the request was modified.

<docs-code language="ts">
const service = TestBed.inject(AuthService);
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config');

expect(req.request.headers.get('X-Authentication-Token')).toEqual(service.getAuthToken());
</docs-code>

A similar interceptor could be implemented with class based interceptors:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  private authService = inject(AuthService);

  intercept(request: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
    const clonedRequest = request.clone({
      headers: request.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', this.authService.getAuthToken()),
    });
    return next.handle(clonedRequest);
  }
}
</docs-code>

In order to test it, the `TestBed` configuration should instead be:

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    AuthService,
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
    // We rely on the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token to register the AuthInterceptor as an HttpInterceptor
    { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true },
  ],
});
</docs-code>
