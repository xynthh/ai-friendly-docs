## Testing Attribute Directives

An *attribute directive* modifies the behavior of an element, component or another directive.
Its name reflects the way the directive is applied: as an attribute on a host element.

### Testing the `HighlightDirective`

The sample application's `HighlightDirective` sets the background color of an element based on either a data bound color or a default color \(lightgray\).
It also sets a custom property of the element \(`customProperty`\) to `true` for no reason other than to show that it can.

<docs-code header="app/shared/highlight.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/highlight.directive.ts"/>

It's used throughout the application, perhaps most simply in the `AboutComponent`:

<docs-code header="app/about/about.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/about/about.component.ts"/>

Testing the specific use of the `HighlightDirective` within the `AboutComponent` requires only the techniques explored in the ["Nested component tests"](guide/testing/components-scenarios#nested-component-tests) section of [Component testing scenarios](guide/testing/components-scenarios).

<docs-code header="app/about/about.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="tests"/>

However, testing a single use case is unlikely to explore the full range of a directive's capabilities.
Finding and testing all components that use the directive is tedious, brittle, and almost as unlikely to afford full coverage.

*Class-only tests* might be helpful, but attribute directives like this one tend to manipulate the DOM.
Isolated unit tests don't touch the DOM and, therefore, do not inspire confidence in the directive's efficacy.

A better solution is to create an artificial test component that demonstrates all ways to apply the directive.

<docs-code header="app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts (TestComponent)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-component"/>

<img alt="HighlightDirective spec in action" src="assets/images/guide/testing/highlight-directive-spec.png">

HELPFUL: The `<input>` case binds the `HighlightDirective` to the name of a color value in the input box.
The initial value is the word "cyan" which should be the background color of the input box.

Here are some tests of this component:

<docs-code header="app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts (selected tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts" visibleRegion="selected-tests"/>

A few techniques are noteworthy:

* The `By.directive` predicate is a great way to get the elements that have this directive *when their element types are unknown*
* The [`:not` pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:not) in `By.css('h2:not([highlight])')` helps find `<h2>` elements that *do not* have the directive.
    `By.css('*:not([highlight])')` finds *any* element that does not have the directive.

* `DebugElement.styles` affords access to element styles even in the absence of a real browser, thanks to the `DebugElement` abstraction.
    But feel free to exploit the `nativeElement` when that seems easier or more clear than the abstraction.

* Angular adds a directive to the injector of the element to which it is applied.
    The test for the default color uses the injector of the second `<h2>` to get its `HighlightDirective` instance and its `defaultColor`.

* `DebugElement.properties` affords access to the artificial custom property that is set by the directive

## Find out how much code you're testing

The Angular CLI can run unit tests and create code coverage reports.
Code coverage reports show you any parts of your code base that might not be properly tested by your unit tests.

To generate a coverage report run the following command in the root of your project.

<docs-code language="shell">
ng test --no-watch --code-coverage
</docs-code>

When the tests are complete, the command creates a new `/coverage` directory in the project.
Open the `index.html` file to see a report with your source code and code coverage values.

If you want to create code-coverage reports every time you test, set the following option in the Angular CLI configuration file, `angular.json`:

<docs-code language="json">
"test": {
  "options": {
    "codeCoverage": true
  }
}
</docs-code>

### Code coverage enforcement

The code coverage percentages let you estimate how much of your code is tested.
If your team decides on a set minimum amount to be unit tested, enforce this minimum with the Angular CLI.

For example, suppose you want the code base to have a minimum of 80% code coverage.
To enable this, open the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test platform configuration file, `karma.conf.js`, and add the `check` property in the `coverageReporter:` key.

<docs-code language="javascript">
coverageReporter: {
  dir: require('path').join(__dirname, './coverage/<project-name>'),
  subdir: '.',
  reporters: [
    { type: 'html' },
    { type: 'text-summary' }
  ],
  check: {
    global: {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80
    }
  }
}
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: Read more about creating and fine tuning Karma configuration in the [testing guide](guide/testing#configuration).

The `check` property causes the tool to enforce a minimum of 80% code coverage when the unit tests are run in the project.

Read more on coverage configuration options in the [karma coverage documentation](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).

## Component harnesses overview

A <strong>component harness</strong> is a class that allows tests to interact with components the way an end user does via a supported API. You can create test harnesses for any component, ranging from small reusable widgets to full pages.

Harnesses offer several benefits:

- They make tests less brittle by insulating themselves against implementation details of a component, such as its DOM structure
- They make tests become more readable and easier to maintain
- They can be used across multiple testing environments

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Example of test with a harness for a component called MyButtonComponent
it('should load button with exact text', async () => {
  const button = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonComponentHarness);
  expect(await button.getText()).toBe('Confirm');
});
</docs-code>

Component harnesses are especially useful for shared UI widgets. Developers often write tests that depend on private implementation details of widgets, such as DOM structure and CSS classes. Those dependencies make tests brittle and hard to maintain. Harnesses offer an alternativeâ€” a supported API that interacts with the widget the same way an end-user does. Widget implementation changes now become less likely to break user tests. For example, [Angular Material](https://material.angular.dev/components/categories) provides a test harness for each component in the library.

Component harnesses support multiple testing environments. You can use the same harness implementation in both unit and end-to-end tests. Test authors only need to learn one API and component authors don't have to maintain separate unit and end-to-end test implementations.

Many developers can be categorized by one of the following developer type categories: test authors, component harness authors, and harness environment authors. Use the table below to find the most relevant section in this guide based on these categories:

| Developer Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Relevant Section                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test Authors                | Developers that use component harnesses written by someone else to test their application. For example, this could be an app developer who uses a third-party menu component and needs to interact with the menu in a unit test.                                                                       | [Using component harnesses in tests](guide/testing/using-component-harnesses)                                |
| Component harness authors   | Developers who maintain some reusable Angular components and want to create a test harness for its users to use in their tests. For example, an author of a third party Angular component library or a developer who maintains a set of common components for a large Angular application.             | [Creating component harnesses for your components](guide/testing/creating-component-harnesses)               |
| Harness environment authors | Developers who want to add support for using component harnesses in additional testing environments. For information on supported testing environments out-of-the-box, see the [test harness environments and loaders](guide/testing/using-component-harnesses#test-harness-environments-and-loaders). | [Adding support for additional testing environments](guide/testing/component-harnesses-testing-environments) |

## Adding harness support for additional testing environments

### Before you start

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [component harnesses overview guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-overview). Read that first if you're new to using component harnesses.

#### When does adding support for a test environment make sense?

To use component harnesses in the following environments, you can use Angular CDK's two built-in environments:

- Unit tests
- WebDriver end-to-end tests

To use a supported testing environment, read the [Creating harnesses for your components guide](guide/testing/creating-component-harnesses).

Otherwise, to add support for other environments, you need to define how to interact with a DOM element and how DOM interactions work in your environment. Continue reading to learn more.

#### CDK Installation

The [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.dev/cdk/categories) is a set of behavior primitives for building components. To use the component harnesses, first install `@angular/cdk` from npm. You can do this from your terminal using the Angular CLI:

<docs-code language="shell">
  ng add @angular/cdk
</docs-code>

### Creating a `TestElement` implementation

Every test environment must define a `TestElement` implementation. The `TestElement` interface serves as an environment-agnostic representation of a DOM element. It enables harnesses to interact with DOM elements regardless of the underlying environment. Because some environments don't support interacting with DOM elements synchronously (e.g. WebDriver), all `TestElement` methods are asynchronous, returning a `Promise` with the result of the operation.

`TestElement` offers a number of methods to interact with the underlying DOM such as `blur()`, `click()`, `getAttribute()`, and more. See the [TestElement API reference page](/api/cdk/testing/TestElement) for the full list of methods.

The `TestElement` interface consists largely of methods that resemble methods available on `HTMLElement`. Similar methods exist in most test environments, which makes implementing the methods fairly straightforward. However, one important difference to note when implementing the `sendKeys` method, is that the key codes in the `TestKey` enum likely differ from the key codes used in the test environment. Environment authors should maintain a mapping from `TestKey` codes to the codes used in the particular testing environment.

The [UnitTestElement](/api/cdk/testing/testbed/UnitTestElement) and [SeleniumWebDriverElement](/api/cdk/testing/selenium-webdriver/SeleniumWebDriverElement) implementations in Angular CDK serve as good examples of implementations of this interface.

### Creating a `HarnessEnvironment` implementation

Test authors use `HarnessEnvironment` to create component harness instances for use in tests. `HarnessEnvironment` is an abstract class that must be extended to create a concrete subclass for the new environment. When supporting a new test environment, create a `HarnessEnvironment` subclass that adds concrete implementations for all abstract members.

`HarnessEnvironment` has a generic type parameter: `HarnessEnvironment<E>`. This parameter, `E`, represents the raw element type of the environment. For example, this parameter is Element for unit test environments.

The following are the abstract methods that must be implemented:

| Method                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abstract getDocumentRoot(): E`                              | Gets the root element for the environment (e.g. `document.body`).                                                                                                    |
| `abstract createTestElement(element: E): TestElement`        | Creates a `TestElement` for the given raw element.                                                                                                                   |
| `abstract createEnvironment(element: E): HarnessEnvironment` | Creates a `HarnessEnvironment` rooted at the given raw element.                                                                                                      |
| `abstract getAllRawElements(selector: string): Promise<E[]>` | Gets all of the raw elements under the root element of the environment matching the given selector.                                                                  |
| `abstract forceStabilize(): Promise<void>`                   | Gets a `Promise` that resolves when the `NgZone` is stable. Additionally, if applicable, tells `NgZone` to stabilize (e.g. calling `flush()` in a `fakeAsync` test). |
| `abstract waitForTasksOutsideAngular(): Promise<void>`       | Gets a `Promise` that resolves when the parent zone of `NgZone` is stable.                                                                                           |

In addition to implementing the missing methods, this class should provide a way for test authors to get `ComponentHarness` instances. You should define a protected constructor and provide a static method called `loader` that returns a `HarnessLoader` instance. This allows test authors to write code like: `SomeHarnessEnvironment.loader().getHarness(...)`. Depending on the needs of the particular environment, the class may provide several different static methods or require arguments to be passed. (e.g. the `loader` method on `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` takes a `ComponentFixture`, and the class provides additional static methods called `documentRootLoader` and `harnessForFixture`).

The [`TestbedHarnessEnvironment`](/api/cdk/testing/testbed/TestbedHarnessEnvironment) and [SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment](/api/cdk/testing/selenium-webdriver/SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment) implementations in Angular CDK serve as good examples of implementations of this interface.

### Handling auto change detection

In order to support the `manualChangeDetection` and parallel APIs, your environment should install a handler for the auto change detection status.

When your environment wants to start handling the auto change detection status it can call `handleAutoChangeDetectionStatus(handler)`. The handler function will receive a `AutoChangeDetectionStatus` which has two properties `isDisabled` and `onDetectChangesNow()`. See the [AutoChangeDetectionStatus API reference page](/api/cdk/testing/AutoChangeDetectionStatus) for more information.
If your environment wants to stop handling auto change detection status it can call `stopHandlingAutoChangeDetectionStatus()`.

(From components-basics.md)

## Basics of testing components

A component, unlike all other parts of an Angular application, combines an HTML template and a TypeScript class.
The component truly is the template and the class *working together*.
To adequately test a component, you should test that they work together as intended.

Such tests require creating the component's host element in the browser DOM, as Angular does, and investigating the component class's interaction with the DOM as described by its template.

The Angular `TestBed` facilitates this kind of testing as you'll see in the following sections.
But in many cases, *testing the component class alone*, without DOM involvement, can validate much of the component's behavior in a straightforward, more obvious way.

### Component DOM testing

A component is more than just its class.
A component interacts with the DOM and with other components.
Classes alone cannot tell you if the component is going to render properly, respond to user input and gestures, or integrate with its parent and child components.

* Is `Lightswitch.clicked()` bound to anything such that the user can invoke it?
* Is the `Lightswitch.message` displayed?
* Can the user actually select the hero displayed by `DashboardHeroComponent`?
* Is the hero name displayed as expected \(such as uppercase\)?
* Is the welcome message displayed by the template of `WelcomeComponent`?

These might not be troubling questions for the preceding simple components illustrated.
But many components have complex interactions with the DOM elements described in their templates, causing HTML to appear and disappear as the component state changes.

To answer these kinds of questions, you have to create the DOM elements associated with the components, you must examine the DOM to confirm that component state displays properly at the appropriate times, and you must simulate user interaction with the screen to determine whether those interactions cause the component to behave as expected.

To write these kinds of test, you'll use additional features of the `TestBed` as well as other testing helpers.

#### CLI-generated tests

The CLI creates an initial test file for you by default when you ask it to generate a new component.

For example, the following CLI command generates a `BannerComponent` in the `app/banner` folder \(with inline template and styles\):

<docs-code language="shell">

ng generate component banner --inline-template --inline-style --module app

</docs-code>

It also generates an initial test file for the component, `banner-external.component.spec.ts`, that looks like this:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (initial)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v1"/>

HELPFUL: Because `compileComponents` is asynchronous, it uses the [`waitForAsync`](api/core/testing/waitForAsync) utility function imported from `@angular/core/testing`.

Refer to the [waitForAsync](guide/testing/components-scenarios#waitForAsync) section for more details.

#### Reduce the setup

Only the last three lines of this file actually test the component and all they do is assert that Angular can create the component.

The rest of the file is boilerplate setup code anticipating more advanced tests that *might* become necessary if the component evolves into something substantial.

You'll learn about these advanced test features in the following sections.
For now, you can radically reduce this test file to a more manageable size:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts (minimal)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v2"/>

In this example, the metadata object passed to `TestBed.configureTestingModule` simply declares `BannerComponent`, the component to test.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="configureTestingModule"/>

HELPFUL: There's no need to declare or import anything else.
The default test module is pre-configured with something like the `BrowserModule` from `@angular/platform-browser`.

Later you'll call `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` with imports, providers, and more declarations to suit your testing needs.
Optional `override` methods can further fine-tune aspects of the configuration.

#### `createComponent()`

After configuring `TestBed`, you call its `createComponent()` method.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="createComponent"/>

`TestBed.createComponent()` creates an instance of the `BannerComponent`, adds a corresponding element to the test-runner DOM, and returns a [`ComponentFixture`](#componentfixture).

IMPORTANT: Do not re-configure `TestBed` after calling `createComponent`.

The `createComponent` method freezes the current `TestBed` definition, closing it to further configuration.

You cannot call any more `TestBed` configuration methods, not `configureTestingModule()`, nor `get()`, nor any of the `override...` methods.
If you try, `TestBed` throws an error.

#### `ComponentFixture`

The [ComponentFixture](api/core/testing/ComponentFixture) is a test harness for interacting with the created component and its corresponding element.

Access the component instance through the fixture and confirm it exists with a Jasmine expectation:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="componentInstance"/>

#### `beforeEach()`

You will add more tests as this component evolves.
Rather than duplicate the `TestBed` configuration for each test, you refactor to pull the setup into a Jasmine `beforeEach()` and some supporting variables:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v3"/>

Now add a test that gets the component's element from `fixture.nativeElement` and looks for the expected text.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-2"/>

#### `nativeElement`

The value of `ComponentFixture.nativeElement` has the `any` type.
Later you'll encounter the `DebugElement.nativeElement` and it too has the `any` type.

Angular can't know at compile time what kind of HTML element the `nativeElement` is or if it even is an HTML element.
The application might be running on a *non-browser platform*, such as the server or a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), where the element might have a diminished API or not exist at all.

The tests in this guide are designed to run in a browser so a `nativeElement` value will always be an `HTMLElement` or one of its derived classes.

Knowing that it is an `HTMLElement` of some sort, use the standard HTML `querySelector` to dive deeper into the element tree.

Here's another test that calls `HTMLElement.querySelector` to get the paragraph element and look for the banner text:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-3"/>

#### `DebugElement`

The Angular *fixture* provides the component's element directly through the `fixture.nativeElement`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="nativeElement"/>

This is actually a convenience method, implemented as `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="debugElement-nativeElement"/>

There's a good reason for this circuitous path to the element.

The properties of the `nativeElement` depend upon the runtime environment.
You could be running these tests on a *non-browser* platform that doesn't have a DOM or whose DOM-emulation doesn't support the full `HTMLElement` API.

Angular relies on the `DebugElement` abstraction to work safely across *all supported platforms*.
Instead of creating an HTML element tree, Angular creates a `DebugElement` tree that wraps the *native elements* for the runtime platform.
The `nativeElement` property unwraps the `DebugElement` and returns the platform-specific element object.

Because the sample tests for this guide are designed to run only in a browser, a `nativeElement` in these tests is always an `HTMLElement` whose familiar methods and properties you can explore within a test.

Here's the previous test, re-implemented with `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-4"/>

The `DebugElement` has other methods and properties that are useful in tests, as you'll see elsewhere in this guide.

You import the `DebugElement` symbol from the Angular core library.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-debug-element"/>

#### `By.css()`

Although the tests in this guide all run in the browser, some applications might run on a different platform at least some of the time.

For example, the component might render first on the server as part of a strategy to make the application launch faster on poorly connected devices.
The server-side renderer might not support the full HTML element API.
If it doesn't support `querySelector`, the previous test could fail.

The `DebugElement` offers query methods that work for all supported platforms.
These query methods take a *predicate* function that returns `true` when a node in the `DebugElement` tree matches the selection criteria.

You create a *predicate* with the help of a `By` class imported from a library for the runtime platform.
Here's the `By` import for the browser platform:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-by"/>

The following example re-implements the previous test with `DebugElement.query()` and the browser's `By.css` method.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-5"/>

Some noteworthy observations:

* The `By.css()` static method selects `DebugElement` nodes with a [standard CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors 'CSS selectors').
* The query returns a `DebugElement` for the paragraph.
* You must unwrap that result to get the paragraph element.

When you're filtering by CSS selector and only testing properties of a browser's *native element*, the `By.css` approach might be overkill.

It's often more straightforward and clear to filter with a standard `HTMLElement` method such as `querySelector()` or `querySelectorAll()`.

## Component testing scenarios

This guide explores common component testing use cases.

### Component binding

In the example application, the `BannerComponent` presents static title text in the HTML template.

After a few changes, the `BannerComponent` presents a dynamic title by binding to the component's `title` property like this.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.ts" visibleRegion="component"/>

As minimal as this is, you decide to add a test to confirm that component actually displays the right content where you think it should.

#### Query for the `<h1>`

You'll write a sequence of tests that inspect the value of the `<h1>` element that wraps the *title* property interpolation binding.

You update the `beforeEach` to find that element with a standard HTML `querySelector` and assign it to the `h1` variable.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

#### `createComponent()` does not bind data

For your first test you'd like to see that the screen displays the default `title`.
Your instinct is to write a test that immediately inspects the `<h1>` like this:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="expect-h1-default-v1"/>

*That test fails* with the message:

<docs-code language="javascript">

expected '' to contain 'Test Tour of Heroes'.

</docs-code>

Binding happens when Angular performs **change detection**.

In production, change detection kicks in automatically when Angular creates a component or the user enters a keystroke, for example.

The `TestBed.createComponent` does not trigger change detection by default; a fact confirmed in the revised test:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-w-o-detect-changes"/>

#### `detectChanges()`

You can tell the `TestBed` to perform data binding by calling `fixture.detectChanges()`.
Only then does the `<h1>` have the expected title.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="expect-h1-default"/>

Delayed change detection is intentional and useful.
It gives the tester an opportunity to inspect and change the state of the component *before Angular initiates data binding and calls [lifecycle hooks](guide/components/lifecycle)*.

Here's another test that changes the component's `title` property *before* calling `fixture.detectChanges()`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="after-change"/>

#### Automatic change detection

The `BannerComponent` tests frequently call `detectChanges`.
Many testers prefer that the Angular test environment run change detection automatically like it does in production.

That's possible by configuring the `TestBed` with the `ComponentFixtureAutoDetect` provider.
First import it from the testing utility library:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts (import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-ComponentFixtureAutoDetect"/>

Then add it to the `providers` array of the testing module configuration:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts (AutoDetect)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts" visibleRegion="auto-detect"/>

HELPFUL: You can also use the `fixture.autoDetectChanges()` function instead if you only want to enable automatic change detection
after making updates to the state of the fixture's component. In addition, automatic change detection is on by default
when using `provideZonelessChangeDetection` and turning it off is not recommended.

Here are three tests that illustrate how automatic change detection works.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts (AutoDetect Tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts" visibleRegion="auto-detect-tests"/>

The first test shows the benefit of automatic change detection.

The second and third test reveal an important limitation.
The Angular testing environment does not run change detection synchronously when updates happen inside the test case that changed the component's `title`.
The test must call `await fixture.whenStable` to wait for another round of change detection.

HELPFUL: Angular does not know about direct updates to values that are not signals. The easiest way to ensure that
change detection will be scheduled is to use signals for values read in the template.

#### Change an input value with `dispatchEvent()`

To simulate user input, find the input element and set its `value` property.

But there is an essential, intermediate step.

Angular doesn't know that you set the input element's `value` property.
It won't read that property until you raise the element's `input` event by calling `dispatchEvent()`.

The following example demonstrates the proper sequence.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (pipe test)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="title-case-pipe"/>

### Component with external files

The preceding `BannerComponent` is defined with an *inline template* and *inline css*, specified in the `@Component.template` and `@Component.styles` properties respectively.

Many components specify *external templates* and *external css* with the `@Component.templateUrl` and `@Component.styleUrls` properties respectively, as the following variant of `BannerComponent` does.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.ts (metadata)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.ts" visibleRegion="metadata"/>

This syntax tells the Angular compiler to read the external files during component compilation.

That's not a problem when you run the CLI `ng test` command because it *compiles the application before running the tests*.

However, if you run the tests in a **non-CLI environment**, tests of this component might fail.
For example, if you run the `BannerComponent` tests in a web coding environment such as [plunker](https://plnkr.co), you'll see a message like this one:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Error: This test module uses the component BannerComponent
which is using a "templateUrl" or "styleUrls", but they were never compiled.
Please call "TestBed.compileComponents" before your test.

</docs-code>

You get this test failure message when the runtime environment compiles the source code *during the tests themselves*.

To correct the problem, call `compileComponents()` as explained in the following [Calling compileComponents](#calling-compilecomponents) section.

### Component with a dependency

Components often have service dependencies.

The `WelcomeComponent` displays a welcome message to the logged-in user.
It knows who the user is based on a property of the injected `UserService`:

<docs-code header="app/welcome/welcome.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.ts"/>

The `WelcomeComponent` has decision logic that interacts with the service, logic that makes this component worth testing.

#### Provide service test doubles

A *component-under-test* doesn't have to be provided with real services.

Injecting the real `UserService` could be difficult.
The real service might ask the user for login credentials and attempt to reach an authentication server.
These behaviors can be hard to intercept. Be aware that using test doubles makes the test behave differently from production so use them sparingly.

#### Get injected services

The tests need access to the `UserService` injected into the `WelcomeComponent`.

Angular has a hierarchical injection system.
There can be injectors at multiple levels, from the root injector created by the `TestBed` down through the component tree.

The safest way to get the injected service, the way that ***always works***,
is to **get it from the injector of the *component-under-test***.
The component injector is a property of the fixture's `DebugElement`.

<docs-code header="WelcomeComponent's injector" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="injected-service"/>

HELPFUL: This is _usually_ not necessary. Services are often provided in the root or the TestBed overrides and can be retrieved more easily with `TestBed.inject()` (see below).

#### `TestBed.inject()`

This is easier to remember and less verbose than retrieving a service using the fixture's `DebugElement`.

In this test suite, the *only* provider of `UserService` is the root testing module, so it is safe to call `TestBed.inject()` as follows:

<docs-code header="TestBed injector" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="inject-from-testbed" />

HELPFUL: For a use case in which `TestBed.inject()` does not work, see the [*Override component providers*](#override-component-providers) section that explains when and why you must get the service from the component's injector instead.

#### Final setup and tests

Here's the complete `beforeEach()`, using `TestBed.inject()`:

<docs-code header="app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

And here are some tests:

<docs-code header="app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="tests"/>

The first is a sanity test; it confirms that the `UserService` is called and working.

HELPFUL: The withContext function \(for example, `'expected name'`\) is an optional failure label.
If the expectation fails, Jasmine appends this label to the expectation failure message.
In a spec with multiple expectations, it can help clarify what went wrong and which expectation failed.

The remaining tests confirm the logic of the component when the service returns different values.
The second test validates the effect of changing the user name.
The third test checks that the component displays the proper message when there is no logged-in user.

### Component with async service

In this sample, the `AboutComponent` template hosts a `TwainComponent`.
The `TwainComponent` displays Mark Twain quotes.

<docs-code header="app/twain/twain.component.ts (template)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.ts" visibleRegion="template" />

HELPFUL: The value of the component's `quote` property passes through an `AsyncPipe`.
That means the property returns either a `Promise` or an `Observable`.

In this example, the `TwainComponent.getQuote()` method tells you that the `quote` property returns an `Observable`.

<docs-code header="app/twain/twain.component.ts (getQuote)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.ts" visibleRegion="get-quote"/>

The `TwainComponent` gets quotes from an injected `TwainService`.
The component starts the returned `Observable` with a placeholder value \(`'...'`\), before the service can return its first quote.

The `catchError` intercepts service errors, prepares an error message, and returns the placeholder value on the success channel.

These are all features you'll want to test.

#### Testing with a spy

When testing a component, only the service's public API should matter.
In general, tests themselves should not make calls to remote servers.
They should emulate such calls.
The setup in this `app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts` shows one way to do that:

<docs-code header="app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

Focus on the spy.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="spy"/>

The spy is designed such that any call to `getQuote` receives an observable with a test quote.
Unlike the real `getQuote()` method, this spy bypasses the server and returns a synchronous observable whose value is available immediately.

You can write many useful tests with this spy, even though its `Observable` is synchronous.

HELPFUL: It is best to limit the usage of spies to only what is necessary for the test. Creating mocks or spies for more than what's necessary can be brittle. As the component and injectable evolves, the unrelated tests can fail because they no longer mock enough behaviors that would otherwise not affect the test.


#### Async test with `fakeAsync()`

To use `fakeAsync()` functionality, you must import `zone.js/testing` in your test setup file.
If you created your project with the Angular CLI, `zone-testing` is already imported in `src/test.ts`.

The following test confirms the expected behavior when the service returns an `ErrorObservable`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="error-test"/>

HELPFUL: The `it()` function receives an argument of the following form.

<docs-code language="javascript">

fakeAsync(() => { /*test body*/ })

</docs-code>

The `fakeAsync()` function enables a linear coding style by running the test body in a special `fakeAsync test zone`.
The test body appears to be synchronous.
There is no nested syntax \(like a `Promise.then()`\) to disrupt the flow of control.

HELPFUL: Limitation: The `fakeAsync()` function won't work if the test body makes an `XMLHttpRequest` \(XHR\) call.
XHR calls within a test are rare, but if you need to call XHR, see the [`waitForAsync()`](#waitForAsync) section.

IMPORTANT: Be aware that asynchronous tasks that happen inside the `fakeAsync` zone need to be manually executed with `flush` or `tick`. If you attempt to
wait for them to complete (i.e. using `fixture.whenStable`) without using the
`fakeAsync` test helpers to advance time, your test will likely fail. See below for more information.

#### The `tick()` function

You do have to call [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) to advance the virtual clock.

Calling [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) simulates the passage of time until all pending asynchronous activities finish.
In this case, it waits for the observable's `setTimeout()`.

The [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) function accepts `millis` and `tickOptions` as parameters. The `millis` parameter specifies how much the virtual clock advances and defaults to `0` if not provided.
For example, if you have a `setTimeout(fn, 100)` in a `fakeAsync()` test, you need to use `tick(100)` to trigger the fn callback.
The optional `tickOptions` parameter has a property named `processNewMacroTasksSynchronously`. The `processNewMacroTasksSynchronously` property represents whether to invoke new generated macro tasks when ticking and defaults to `true`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-tick"/>

The [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) function is one of the Angular testing utilities that you import with `TestBed`.
It's a companion to `fakeAsync()` and you can only call it within a `fakeAsync()` body.

#### tickOptions

In this example, you have a new macro task, the nested `setTimeout` function. By default, when the `tick` is setTimeout, `outside` and `nested` will both be triggered.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-tick-new-macro-task-sync"/>

In some case, you don't want to trigger the new macro task when ticking. You can use `tick(millis, {processNewMacroTasksSynchronously: false})` to not invoke a new macro task.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-tick-new-macro-task-async"/>

#### Comparing dates inside fakeAsync()

`fakeAsync()` simulates passage of time, which lets you calculate the difference between dates inside `fakeAsync()`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-date"/>

#### jasmine.clock with fakeAsync()

Jasmine also provides a `clock` feature to mock dates.
Angular automatically runs tests that are run after `jasmine.clock().install()` is called inside a `fakeAsync()` method until `jasmine.clock().uninstall()` is called.
`fakeAsync()` is not needed and throws an error if nested.

By default, this feature is disabled.
To enable it, set a global flag before importing `zone-testing`.

If you use the Angular CLI, configure this flag in `src/test.ts`.

<docs-code language="typescript">

[window as any]('&lowbar;&lowbar;zone&lowbar;symbol__fakeAsyncPatchLock') = true;
import 'zone.js/testing';

</docs-code>

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-clock"/>

#### Using the RxJS scheduler inside fakeAsync()

You can also use RxJS scheduler in `fakeAsync()` just like using `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`, but you need to import `zone.js/plugins/zone-patch-rxjs-fake-async` to patch RxJS scheduler.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-rxjs"/>

#### Support more macroTasks

By default, `fakeAsync()` supports the following macro tasks.

* `setTimeout`
* `setInterval`
* `requestAnimationFrame`
* `webkitRequestAnimationFrame`
* `mozRequestAnimationFrame`

If you run other macro tasks such as `HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob()`, an *"Unknown macroTask scheduled in fake async test"* error is thrown.

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts (failing)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="without-toBlob-macrotask"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" visibleRegion="main"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

If you want to support such a case, you need to define the macro task you want to support in `beforeEach()`.
For example:

<docs-code header="src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="enable-toBlob-macrotask"/>

HELPFUL: In order to make the `<canvas>` element Zone.js-aware in your app, you need to import the `zone-patch-canvas` patch \(either in `polyfills.ts` or in the specific file that uses `<canvas>`\):

<docs-code header="src/polyfills.ts or src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-canvas-patch"/>

#### Async observables

You might be satisfied with the test coverage of these tests.

However, you might be troubled by the fact that the real service doesn't quite behave this way.
The real service sends requests to a remote server.
A server takes time to respond and the response certainly won't be available immediately as in the previous two tests.

Your tests will reflect the real world more faithfully if you return an *asynchronous* observable from the `getQuote()` spy like this.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="async-setup"/>

#### Async observable helpers

The async observable was produced by an `asyncData` helper.
The `asyncData` helper is a utility function that you'll have to write yourself, or copy this one from the sample code.

<docs-code header="testing/async-observable-helpers.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/testing/async-observable-helpers.ts" visibleRegion="async-data"/>

This helper's observable emits the `data` value in the next turn of the JavaScript engine.

The [RxJS `defer()` operator](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/defer.html) returns an observable.
It takes a factory function that returns either a promise or an observable.
When something subscribes to *defer*'s observable, it adds the subscriber to a new observable created with that factory.

The `defer()` operator transforms the `Promise.resolve()` into a new observable that, like `HttpClient`, emits once and completes.
Subscribers are unsubscribed after they receive the data value.

There's a similar helper for producing an async error.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/testing/async-observable-helpers.ts" visibleRegion="async-error"/>

#### More async tests

Now that the `getQuote()` spy is returning async observables, most of your tests will have to be async as well.

Here's a `fakeAsync()` test that demonstrates the data flow you'd expect in the real world.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test"/>

Notice that the quote element displays the placeholder value \(`'...'`\) after `ngOnInit()`.
The first quote hasn't arrived yet.

To flush the first quote from the observable, you call [tick()](api/core/testing/tick).
Then call `detectChanges()` to tell Angular to update the screen.

Then you can assert that the quote element displays the expected text.

#### Async test without `fakeAsync()`

Here's the previous `fakeAsync()` test, re-written with the `async`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="async-test"/>

#### `whenStable`

The test must wait for the `getQuote()` observable to emit the next quote.
Instead of calling [tick()](api/core/testing/tick), it calls `fixture.whenStable()`.

The `fixture.whenStable()` returns a promise that resolves when the JavaScript engine's task queue becomes empty.
In this example, the task queue becomes empty when the observable emits the first quote.


### Component with inputs and outputs

A component with inputs and outputs typically appears inside the view template of a host component.
The host uses a property binding to set the input property and an event binding to listen to events raised by the output property.

The testing goal is to verify that such bindings work as expected.
The tests should set input values and listen for output events.

The `DashboardHeroComponent` is a tiny example of a component in this role.
It displays an individual hero provided by the `DashboardComponent`.
Clicking that hero tells the `DashboardComponent` that the user has selected the hero.

The `DashboardHeroComponent` is embedded in the `DashboardComponent` template like this:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html" visibleRegion="dashboard-hero"/>

The `DashboardHeroComponent` appears in an `*ngFor` repeater, which sets each component's `hero` input property to the looping value and listens for the component's `selected` event.

Here's the component's full definition:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.ts (component)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.ts" visibleRegion="component"/>

While testing a component this simple has little intrinsic value, it's worth knowing how.
Use one of these approaches:

* Test it as used by `DashboardComponent`
* Test it as a standalone component
* Test it as used by a substitute for `DashboardComponent`

The immediate goal is to test the `DashboardHeroComponent`, not the `DashboardComponent`, so, try the second and third options.

#### Test `DashboardHeroComponent` standalone

Here's the meat of the spec file setup.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

Notice how the setup code assigns a test hero \(`expectedHero`\) to the component's `hero` property, emulating the way the `DashboardComponent` would set it using the property binding in its repeater.

The following test verifies that the hero name is propagated to the template using a binding.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="name-test"/>

Because the [template](#dashboard-hero-component) passes the hero name through the Angular `UpperCasePipe`, the test must match the element value with the upper-cased name.

#### Clicking

Clicking the hero should raise a `selected` event that the host component \(`DashboardComponent` presumably\) can hear:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="click-test"/>

The component's `selected` property returns an `EventEmitter`, which looks like an RxJS synchronous `Observable` to consumers.
The test subscribes to it *explicitly* just as the host component does *implicitly*.

If the component behaves as expected, clicking the hero's element should tell the component's `selected` property to emit the `hero` object.

The test detects that event through its subscription to `selected`.

#### `triggerEventHandler`

The `heroDe` in the previous test is a `DebugElement` that represents the hero `<div>`.

It has Angular properties and methods that abstract interaction with the native element.
This test calls the `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` with the "click" event name.
The "click" event binding responds by calling `DashboardHeroComponent.click()`.

The Angular `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` can raise *any data-bound event* by its *event name*.
The second parameter is the event object passed to the handler.

The test triggered a "click" event.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-event-handler"/>

In this case, the test correctly assumes that the runtime event handler, the component's `click()` method, doesn't care about the event object.

HELPFUL: Other handlers are less forgiving.
For example, the `RouterLink` directive expects an object with a `button` property that identifies which mouse button, if any, was pressed during the click.
The `RouterLink` directive throws an error if the event object is missing.

#### Click the element

The following test alternative calls the native element's own `click()` method, which is perfectly fine for *this component*.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="click-test-2"/>

#### `click()` helper

Clicking a button, an anchor, or an arbitrary HTML element is a common test task.

Make that consistent and straightforward by encapsulating the *click-triggering* process in a helper such as the following `click()` function:

<docs-code header="testing/index.ts (click helper)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/testing/index.ts" visibleRegion="click-event"/>

The first parameter is the *element-to-click*.
If you want, pass a custom event object as the second parameter.
The default is a partial [left-button mouse event object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button) accepted by many handlers including the `RouterLink` directive.

IMPORTANT: The `click()` helper function is **not** one of the Angular testing utilities.
It's a function defined in *this guide's sample code*.
All of the sample tests use it.
If you like it, add it to your own collection of helpers.

Here's the previous test, rewritten using the click helper.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test with click helper)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="click-test-3"/>

### Component inside a test host

The previous tests played the role of the host `DashboardComponent` themselves.
But does the `DashboardHeroComponent` work correctly when properly data-bound to a host component?

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test host)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-host"/>

The test host sets the component's `hero` input property with its test hero.
It binds the component's `selected` event with its `onSelected` handler, which records the emitted hero in its `selectedHero` property.

Later, the tests will be able to check `selectedHero` to verify that the `DashboardHeroComponent.selected` event emitted the expected hero.

The setup for the `test-host` tests is similar to the setup for the stand-alone tests:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test host setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-host-setup"/>

This testing module configuration shows three important differences:

* It *imports* both the `DashboardHeroComponent` and the `TestHostComponent`
* It *creates* the `TestHostComponent` instead of the `DashboardHeroComponent`
* The `TestHostComponent` sets the `DashboardHeroComponent.hero` with a binding

The `createComponent` returns a `fixture` that holds an instance of `TestHostComponent` instead of an instance of `DashboardHeroComponent`.

Creating the `TestHostComponent` has the side effect of creating a `DashboardHeroComponent` because the latter appears within the template of the former.
The query for the hero element \(`heroEl`\) still finds it in the test DOM, albeit at greater depth in the element tree than before.

The tests themselves are almost identical to the stand-alone version:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test-host)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-host-tests"/>

Only the selected event test differs.
It confirms that the selected `DashboardHeroComponent` hero really does find its way up through the event binding to the host component.

### Routing component

A *routing component* is a component that tells the `Router` to navigate to another component.
The `DashboardComponent` is a *routing component* because the user can navigate to the `HeroDetailComponent` by clicking on one of the *hero buttons* on the dashboard.

Angular provides test helpers to reduce boilerplate and more effectively test code which depends on `HttpClient`. The `provideRouter` function can be used directly in the test module as well.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="router-harness"/>

The following test clicks the displayed hero and confirms that we navigate to the expected URL.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts (navigate test)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="navigate-test"/>

### Routed components

A *routed component* is the destination of a `Router` navigation.
It can be trickier to test, especially when the route to the component *includes parameters*.
The `HeroDetailComponent` is a *routed component* that is the destination of such a route.

When a user clicks a *Dashboard* hero, the `DashboardComponent` tells the `Router` to navigate to `heroes/:id`.
The `:id` is a route parameter whose value is the `id` of the hero to edit.

The `Router` matches that URL to a route to the `HeroDetailComponent`.
It creates an `ActivatedRoute` object with the routing information and injects it into a new instance of the `HeroDetailComponent`.

Here are the services injected into `HeroDetailComponent`:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts (inject)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts" visibleRegion="inject"/>

The `HeroDetail` component needs the `id` parameter so it can fetch the corresponding hero using the `HeroDetailService`.
The component has to get the `id` from the `ActivatedRoute.paramMap` property which is an `Observable`.

It can't just reference the `id` property of the `ActivatedRoute.paramMap`.
The component has to *subscribe* to the `ActivatedRoute.paramMap` observable and be prepared for the `id` to change during its lifetime.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts (constructor)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts" visibleRegion="ctor"/>

Tests can explore how the `HeroDetailComponent` responds to different `id` parameter values by navigating to different routes.

#### Testing with the `RouterTestingHarness`

Here's a test demonstrating the component's behavior when the observed `id` refers to an existing hero:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (existing id)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="route-good-id"/>

HELPFUL: In the following section, the `createComponent()` method and `page` object are discussed.
Rely on your intuition for now.

When the `id` cannot be found, the component should re-route to the `HeroListComponent`.

The test suite setup provided the same router harness [described above](#routing-component).

This test expects the component to try to navigate to the `HeroListComponent`.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (bad id)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="route-bad-id"/>

### Nested component tests

Component templates often have nested components, whose templates might contain more components.

The component tree can be very deep and sometimes the nested components play no role in testing the component at the top of the tree.

The `AppComponent`, for example, displays a navigation bar with anchors and their `RouterLink` directives.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.html"/>

To validate the links but not the navigation, you don't need the `Router` to navigate and you don't need the `<router-outlet>` to mark where the `Router` inserts *routed components*.

The `BannerComponent` and `WelcomeComponent` \(indicated by `<app-banner>` and `<app-welcome>`\) are also irrelevant.

Yet any test that creates the `AppComponent` in the DOM also creates instances of these three components and, if you let that happen, you'll have to configure the `TestBed` to create them.

If you neglect to declare them, the Angular compiler won't recognize the `<app-banner>`, `<app-welcome>`, and `<router-outlet>` tags in the `AppComponent` template and will throw an error.

If you declare the real components, you'll also have to declare *their* nested components and provide for *all* services injected in *any* component in the tree.

This section describes two techniques for minimizing the setup.
Use them, alone or in combination, to stay focused on testing the primary component.

#### Stubbing unneeded components

In the first technique, you create and declare stub versions of the components and directive that play little or no role in the tests.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (stub declaration)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="component-stubs"/>

The stub selectors match the selectors for the corresponding real components.
But their templates and classes are empty.

Then declare them in the `TestBed` configuration next to the components, directives, and pipes that need to be real.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (TestBed stubs)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="testbed-stubs"/>

The `AppComponent` is the test subject, so of course you declare the real version.

The rest are stubs.

#### `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA`

In the second approach, add `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` to the `TestBed.schemas` metadata.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-errors-schema"/>

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` tells the Angular compiler to ignore unrecognized elements and attributes.

The compiler recognizes the `<app-root>` element and the `routerLink` attribute because you declared a corresponding `AppComponent` and `RouterLink` in the `TestBed` configuration.

But the compiler won't throw an error when it encounters `<app-banner>`, `<app-welcome>`, or `<router-outlet>`.
It simply renders them as empty tags and the browser ignores them.

You no longer need the stub components.

#### Use both techniques together

These are techniques for *Shallow Component Testing*, so-named because they reduce the visual surface of the component to just those elements in the component's template that matter for tests.

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` approach is the easier of the two but don't overuse it.

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` also prevents the compiler from telling you about the missing components and attributes that you omitted inadvertently or misspelled.
You could waste hours chasing phantom bugs that the compiler would have caught in an instant.

The *stub component* approach has another advantage.
While the stubs in *this* example were empty, you could give them stripped-down templates and classes if your tests need to interact with them in some way.

In practice you will combine the two techniques in the same setup, as seen in this example.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (mixed setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="mixed-setup"/>

The Angular compiler creates the `BannerStubComponent` for the `<app-banner>` element and applies the `RouterLink` to the anchors with the `routerLink` attribute, but it ignores the `<app-welcome>` and `<router-outlet>` tags.

#### `By.directive` and injected directives

A little more setup triggers the initial data binding and gets references to the navigation links:

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (test setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-setup"/>

Three points of special interest:

* Locate the anchor elements with an attached directive using `By.directive`
* The query returns `DebugElement` wrappers around the matching elements
* Each `DebugElement` exposes a dependency injector with the specific instance of the directive attached to that element

The `AppComponent` links to validate are as follows:

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html (navigation links)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="links"/>

Here are some tests that confirm those links are wired to the `routerLink` directives as expected:

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (selected tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="tests"/>

### Use a `page` object

The `HeroDetailComponent` is a simple view with a title, two hero fields, and two buttons.

But there's plenty of template complexity even in this simple form.

<docs-code
  path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.html" header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.html"/>

Tests that exercise the component need â€¦

* To wait until a hero arrives before elements appear in the DOM
* A reference to the title text
* A reference to the name input box to inspect and set it
* References to the two buttons so they can click them

Even a small form such as this one can produce a mess of tortured conditional setup and CSS element selection.

Tame the complexity with a `Page` class that handles access to component properties and encapsulates the logic that sets them.

Here is such a `Page` class for the `hero-detail.component.spec.ts`

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (Page)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="page"/>

Now the important hooks for component manipulation and inspection are neatly organized and accessible from an instance of `Page`.

A `createComponent` method creates a `page` object and fills in the blanks once the `hero` arrives.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (createComponent)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="create-component"/>

Here are a few more `HeroDetailComponent` tests to reinforce the point.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (selected tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="selected-tests"/>

### Calling `compileComponents()`

HELPFUL: Ignore this section if you *only* run tests with the CLI `ng test` command because the CLI compiles the application before running the tests.

If you run tests in a **non-CLI environment**, the tests might fail with a message like this one:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Error: This test module uses the component BannerComponent
which is using a "templateUrl" or "styleUrls", but they were never compiled.
Please call "TestBed.compileComponents" before your test.

</docs-code>

The root of the problem is at least one of the components involved in the test specifies an external template or CSS file as the following version of the `BannerComponent` does.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.ts (external template & css)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.ts"/>

The test fails when the `TestBed` tries to create the component.

<docs-code avoid header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (setup that fails)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-may-fail"/>

Recall that the application hasn't been compiled.
So when you call `createComponent()`, the `TestBed` compiles implicitly.

That's not a problem when the source code is in memory.
But the `BannerComponent` requires external files that the compiler must read from the file system, an inherently *asynchronous* operation.

If the `TestBed` were allowed to continue, the tests would run and fail mysteriously before the compiler could finish.

The preemptive error message tells you to compile explicitly with `compileComponents()`.

#### `compileComponents()` is async

You must call `compileComponents()` within an asynchronous test function.

CRITICAL: If you neglect to make the test function async (for example, forget to use `waitForAsync()` as described), you'll see this error message

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Error: ViewDestroyedError: Attempt to use a destroyed view

</docs-code>

A typical approach is to divide the setup logic into two separate `beforeEach()` functions:

| Functions                   | Details                      |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Asynchronous `beforeEach()` | Compiles the components      |
| Synchronous `beforeEach()`  | Performs the remaining setup |

#### The async `beforeEach`

Write the first async `beforeEach` like this.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (async beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="async-before-each"/>

The `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` method returns the `TestBed` class so you can chain calls to other `TestBed` static methods such as `compileComponents()`.

In this example, the `BannerComponent` is the only component to compile.
Other examples configure the testing module with multiple components and might import application modules that hold yet more components.
Any of them could require external files.

The `TestBed.compileComponents` method asynchronously compiles all components configured in the testing module.

IMPORTANT: Do not re-configure the `TestBed` after calling `compileComponents()`.

Calling `compileComponents()` closes the current `TestBed` instance to further configuration.
You cannot call any more `TestBed` configuration methods, not `configureTestingModule()` nor any of the `override...` methods.
The `TestBed` throws an error if you try.

Make `compileComponents()` the last step before calling `TestBed.createComponent()`.

#### The synchronous `beforeEach`

The second, synchronous `beforeEach()` contains the remaining setup steps, which include creating the component and querying for elements to inspect.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (synchronous beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="sync-before-each"/>

Count on the test runner to wait for the first asynchronous `beforeEach` to finish before calling the second.

#### Consolidated setup

You can consolidate the two `beforeEach()` functions into a single, async `beforeEach()`.

The `compileComponents()` method returns a promise so you can perform the synchronous setup tasks *after* compilation by moving the synchronous code after the `await` keyword, where the promise has been resolved.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (one beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="one-before-each"/>

#### `compileComponents()` is harmless

There's no harm in calling `compileComponents()` when it's not required.

The component test file generated by the CLI calls `compileComponents()` even though it is never required when running `ng test`.

The tests in this guide only call `compileComponents` when necessary.

### Setup with module imports

Earlier component tests configured the testing module with a few `declarations` like this:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (configure TestBed)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="config-testbed"/>

The `DashboardComponent` is simple.
It needs no help.
But more complex components often depend on other components, directives, pipes, and providers and these must be added to the testing module too.

Fortunately, the `TestBed.configureTestingModule` parameter parallels the metadata passed to the `@NgModule` decorator which means you can also specify `providers` and `imports`.

The `HeroDetailComponent` requires a lot of help despite its small size and simple construction.
In addition to the support it receives from the default testing module `CommonModule`, it needs:

* `NgModel` and friends in the `FormsModule` to enable two-way data binding
* The `TitleCasePipe` from the `shared` folder
* The Router services
* The Hero data access services

One approach is to configure the testing module from the individual pieces as in this example:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (FormsModule setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-forms-module"/>

HELPFUL: Notice that the `beforeEach()` is asynchronous and calls `TestBed.compileComponents` because the `HeroDetailComponent` has an external template and css file.

As explained in [Calling `compileComponents()`](#calling-compilecomponents), these tests could be run in a non-CLI environment where Angular would have to compile them in the browser.

#### Import a shared module

Because many application components need the `FormsModule` and the `TitleCasePipe`, the developer created a `SharedModule` to combine these and other frequently requested parts.

The test configuration can use the `SharedModule` too as seen in this alternative setup:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (SharedModule setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-shared-module"/>

It's a bit tighter and smaller, with fewer import statements, which are not shown in this example.

#### Import a feature module

The `HeroDetailComponent` is part of the `HeroModule` [Feature Module](guide/ngmodules/feature-modules) that aggregates more of the interdependent pieces including the `SharedModule`.
Try a test configuration that imports the `HeroModule` like this one:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (HeroModule setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-hero-module"/>

Only the *test doubles* in the `providers` remain.
Even the `HeroDetailComponent` declaration is gone.

In fact, if you try to declare it, Angular will throw an error because `HeroDetailComponent` is declared in both the `HeroModule` and the `DynamicTestModule` created by the `TestBed`.

HELPFUL: Importing the component's feature module can be the best way to configure tests when there are many mutual dependencies within the module and the module is small, as feature modules tend to be.

### Override component providers

The `HeroDetailComponent` provides its own `HeroDetailService`.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts (prototype)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts" visibleRegion="prototype"/>

It's not possible to stub the component's `HeroDetailService` in the `providers` of the `TestBed.configureTestingModule`.
Those are providers for the *testing module*, not the component.
They prepare the dependency injector at the *fixture level*.

Angular creates the component with its *own* injector, which is a *child* of the fixture injector.
It registers the component's providers \(the `HeroDetailService` in this case\) with the child injector.

A test cannot get to child injector services from the fixture injector.
And `TestBed.configureTestingModule` can't configure them either.

Angular has created new instances of the real `HeroDetailService` all along!

HELPFUL: These tests could fail or timeout if the `HeroDetailService` made its own XHR calls to a remote server.
There might not be a remote server to call.

Fortunately, the `HeroDetailService` delegates responsibility for remote data access to an injected `HeroService`.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.service.ts (prototype)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.service.ts" visibleRegion="prototype"/>

The [previous test configuration](#import-a-feature-module) replaces the real `HeroService` with a `TestHeroService` that intercepts server requests and fakes their responses.

What if you aren't so lucky.
What if faking the `HeroService` is hard?
What if `HeroDetailService` makes its own server requests?

The `TestBed.overrideComponent` method can replace the component's `providers` with easy-to-manage *test doubles* as seen in the following setup variation:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (Override setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-override"/>

Notice that `TestBed.configureTestingModule` no longer provides a fake `HeroService` because it's [not needed](#spy-stub).

#### The `overrideComponent` method

Focus on the `overrideComponent` method.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (overrideComponent)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="override-component-method"/>

It takes two arguments: the component type to override \(`HeroDetailComponent`\) and an override metadata object.
The [override metadata object](guide/testing/utility-apis#metadata-override-object) is a generic defined as follows:

<docs-code language="javascript">

type MetadataOverride<T> = {
  add?: Partial<T>;
  remove?: Partial<T>;
  set?: Partial<T>;
};

</docs-code>

A metadata override object can either add-and-remove elements in metadata properties or completely reset those properties.
This example resets the component's `providers` metadata.

The type parameter, `T`, is the kind of metadata you'd pass to the `@Component` decorator:

<docs-code language="javascript">

selector?: string;
template?: string;
templateUrl?: string;
providers?: any[];
â€¦

</docs-code>

#### Provide a *spy stub* (`HeroDetailServiceSpy`)

This example completely replaces the component's `providers` array with a new array containing a `HeroDetailServiceSpy`.

The `HeroDetailServiceSpy` is a stubbed version of the real `HeroDetailService` that fakes all necessary features of that service.
It neither injects nor delegates to the lower level `HeroService` so there's no need to provide a test double for that.

The related `HeroDetailComponent` tests will assert that methods of the `HeroDetailService` were called by spying on the service methods.
Accordingly, the stub implements its methods as spies:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (HeroDetailServiceSpy)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="hds-spy"/>

#### The override tests

Now the tests can control the component's hero directly by manipulating the spy-stub's `testHero` and confirm that service methods were called.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (override tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="override-tests"/>

#### More overrides

The `TestBed.overrideComponent` method can be called multiple times for the same or different components.
The `TestBed` offers similar `overrideDirective`, `overrideModule`, and `overridePipe` methods for digging into and replacing parts of these other classes.

Explore the options and combinations on your own.

## Creating harnesses for your components

### Before you start

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [component harnesses overview guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-overview). Read that first if you're new to using component harnesses.

#### When does creating a test harness make sense?

The Angular team recommends creating component test harnesses for shared components that are used in many places and have some user interactivity. This most commonly applies to widget libraries and similar reusable components. Harnesses are valuable for these cases because they provide the consumers of these shared components a well- supported API for interacting with a component. Tests that use harnesses can avoid depending on unreliable implementation details of these shared components, such as DOM structure and specific event listeners.

For components that appear in only one place, such as a page in an application, harnesses don't provide as much benefit. In these situations, a component's tests can reasonably depend on the implementation details of this component, as the tests and components are updated at the same time. However, harnesses still provide some value if you would use the harness in both unit and end-to-end tests.

#### CDK Installation

The [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.dev/cdk/categories) is a set of behavior primitives for building components. To use the component harnesses, first install `@angular/cdk` from npm. You can do this from your terminal using the Angular CLI:

<docs-code language="shell">
  ng add @angular/cdk
</docs-code>

### Extending `ComponentHarness`

The abstract `ComponentHarness` class is the base class for all component harnesses. To create a custom component harness, extend `ComponentHarness` and implement the static property `hostSelector`.

The `hostSelector` property identifies elements in the DOM that match this harness subclass. In most cases, the `hostSelector` should be the same as the selector of the corresponding `Component` or `Directive`. For example, consider a simple popup component:

<docs-code language="typescript">
@Component({
  selector: 'my-popup',
  template: `
    <button (click)="toggle()">{{triggerText()}}</button>
    @if (isOpen()) {
      <div class="my-popup-content"><ng-content></ng-content></div>
    }
  `
})
class MyPopup {
  triggerText = input('');

isOpen = signal(false);

toggle() {
this.isOpen.update((value) => !value);
}
}
</docs-code>

In this case, a minimal harness for the component would look like the following:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';
}
</docs-code>

While `ComponentHarness` subclasses require only the `hostSelector` property, most harnesses should also implement a static `with` method to generate `HarnessPredicate` instances. The [filtering harnesses section](guide/testing/using-component-harnesses#filtering-harnesses) covers this in more detail.

### Finding elements in the component's DOM

Each instance of a `ComponentHarness` subclass represents a particular instance of the corresponding component. You can access the component's host element via the `host() `method from the `ComponentHarness` base class.

`ComponentHarness` also offers several methods for locating elements within the component's DOM. These methods are `locatorFor()`, `locatorForOptional()`, and `locatorForAll()`. These methods create functions that find elements, they do not directly find elements. This approach safeguards against caching references to out-of-date elements. For example, when an `ngIf` hides and then shows an element, the result is a new DOM element; using functions ensures that tests always reference the current state of the DOM.

See the [ComponentHarness API reference page](/api/cdk/testing/ComponentHarness) for the full list details of the different `locatorFor` methods.

For example, the `MyPopupHarness` example discussed above could provide methods to get the trigger and content elements as follows:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';

/\*_ Gets the trigger element _/
getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');

/\*_ Gets the content element. _/
getContentElement = this.locatorForOptional('.my-popup-content');
}
</docs-code>

### Working with `TestElement` instances

`TestElement` is an abstraction designed to work across different test environments (Unit tests, WebDriver, etc). When using harnesses, you should perform all DOM interaction via this interface. Other means of accessing DOM elements, such as `document.querySelector()`, do not work in all test environments.

`TestElement` has a number of methods to interact with the underlying DOM, such as `blur()`, `click()`, `getAttribute()`, and more. See the [TestElement API reference page](/api/cdk/testing/TestElement) for the full list of methods.

Do not expose `TestElement` instances to harness users unless it's an element the component consumer defines directly, such as the component's host element. Exposing `TestElement` instances for internal elements leads users to depend on a component's internal DOM structure.

Instead, provide more narrow-focused methods for specific actions the end-user may take or particular state they may observe. For example, `MyPopupHarness` from previous sections could provide methods like `toggle` and `isOpen`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';

protected getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');
protected getContentElement = this.locatorForOptional('.my-popup-content');

/\*_ Toggles the open state of the popup. _/
async toggle() {
const trigger = await this.getTriggerElement();
return trigger.click();
}

/\*_ Checks if the popup us open. _/
async isOpen() {
const content = await this.getContentElement();
return !!content;
}
}
</docs-code>

### Loading harnesses for subcomponents

Larger components often compose sub-components. You can reflect this structure in a component's harness as well. Each of the `locatorFor` methods on `ComponentHarness` has an alternate signature that can be used for locating sub-harnesses rather than elements.

See the [ComponentHarness API reference page](/api/cdk/testing/ComponentHarness) for the full list of the different locatorFor methods.

For example, consider a menu build using the popup from above:

<docs-code language="typescript">
@Directive({
  selector: 'my-menu-item'
})
class MyMenuItem {}

@Component({
selector: 'my-menu',
template: `     <my-popup>
      <ng-content></ng-content>
    </my-popup>
  `
})
class MyMenu {
triggerText = input('');

@ContentChildren(MyMenuItem) items: QueryList<MyMenuItem>;
}
</docs-code>

The harness for `MyMenu` can then take advantage of other harnesses for `MyPopup` and `MyMenuItem`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyMenuHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu';

protected getPopupHarness = this.locatorFor(MyPopupHarness);

/\*_ Gets the currently shown menu items (empty list if menu is closed). _/
getItems = this.locatorForAll(MyMenuItemHarness);

/\*_ Toggles open state of the menu. _/
async toggle() {
const popupHarness = await this.getPopupHarness();
return popupHarness.toggle();
}
}

class MyMenuItemHarness extends ComponentHarness {
static hostSelector = 'my-menu-item';
}
</docs-code>

### Filtering harness instances with `HarnessPredicate`

When a page contains multiple instances of a particular component, you may want to filter based on some property of the component to get a particular component instance. For example, you may want a button with some specific text, or a menu with a specific ID. The `HarnessPredicate` class can capture criteria like this for a `ComponentHarness` subclass. While the test author is able to construct `HarnessPredicate` instances manually, it's easier when the `ComponentHarness` subclass provides a helper method to construct predicates for common filters.

You should create a static `with()` method on each `ComponentHarness` subclass that returns a `HarnessPredicate` for that class. This allows test authors to write easily understandable code, e.g. `loader.getHarness(MyMenuHarness.with({selector: '#menu1'}))`. In addition to the standard selector and ancestor options, the `with` method should add any other options that make sense for the particular subclass.

Harnesses that need to add additional options should extend the `BaseHarnessFilters` interface and additional optional properties as needed. `HarnessPredicate` provides several convenience methods for adding options: `stringMatches()`, `addOption()`, and `add()`. See the [HarnessPredicate API page](/api/cdk/testing/HarnessPredicate) for the full description.

For example, when working with a menu it is useful to filter based on trigger text and to filter menu items based on their text:

<docs-code language="typescript">
interface MyMenuHarnessFilters extends BaseHarnessFilters {
  /** Filters based on the trigger text for the menu. */
  triggerText?: string | RegExp;
}

interface MyMenuItemHarnessFilters extends BaseHarnessFilters {
/\*_ Filters based on the text of the menu item. _/
text?: string | RegExp;
}

class MyMenuHarness extends ComponentHarness {
static hostSelector = 'my-menu';

/\*_ Creates a `HarnessPredicate` used to locate a particular `MyMenuHarness`. _/
static with(options: MyMenuHarnessFilters): HarnessPredicate<MyMenuHarness> {
return new HarnessPredicate(MyMenuHarness, options)
.addOption('trigger text', options.triggerText,
(harness, text) => HarnessPredicate.stringMatches(harness.getTriggerText(), text));
}

protected getPopupHarness = this.locatorFor(MyPopupHarness);

/\*_ Gets the text of the menu trigger. _/
async getTriggerText(): Promise<string> {
const popupHarness = await this.getPopupHarness();
return popupHarness.getTriggerText();
}
...
}

class MyMenuItemHarness extends ComponentHarness {
static hostSelector = 'my-menu-item';

/\*_ Creates a `HarnessPredicate` used to locate a particular `MyMenuItemHarness`. _/
static with(options: MyMenuItemHarnessFilters): HarnessPredicate<MyMenuItemHarness> {
return new HarnessPredicate(MyMenuItemHarness, options)
.addOption('text', options.text,
(harness, text) => HarnessPredicate.stringMatches(harness.getText(), text));
}

/\*_ Gets the text of the menu item. _/
async getText(): Promise<string> {
const host = await this.host();
return host.text();
}
}
</docs-code>

You can pass a `HarnessPredicate` instead of a `ComponentHarness` class to any of the APIs on `HarnessLoader`, `LocatorFactory`, or `ComponentHarness`. This allows test authors to easily target a particular component instance when creating a harness instance. It also allows the harness author to leverage the same `HarnessPredicate` to enable more powerful APIs on their harness class. For example, consider the `getItems` method on the `MyMenuHarness` shown above. Adding a filtering API allows users of the harness to search for particular menu items:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyMenuHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu';

/\*_ Gets a list of items in the menu, optionally filtered based on the given criteria. _/
async getItems(filters: MyMenuItemHarnessFilters = {}): Promise<MyMenuItemHarness[]> {
const getFilteredItems = this.locatorForAll(MyMenuItemHarness.with(filters));
return getFilteredItems();
}
...
}
</docs-code>

### Creating `HarnessLoader` for elements that use content projection

Some components project additional content into the component's template. See the [content projection guide](guide/components/content-projection) for more information.

Add a `HarnessLoader` instance scoped to the element containing the `<ng-content>` when you create a harness for a component that uses content projection. This allows the user of the harness to load additional harnesses for whatever components were passed in as content. `ComponentHarness` has several methods that can be used to create HarnessLoader instances for cases like this: `harnessLoaderFor()`, `harnessLoaderForOptional()`, `harnessLoaderForAll()`. See the [HarnessLoader interface API reference page](/api/cdk/testing/HarnessLoader) for more details.

For example, the `MyPopupHarness` example from above can extend `ContentContainerComponentHarness` to add support to load harnesses within the `<ng-content>` of the component.

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ContentContainerComponentHarness<string> {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';
}
</docs-code>

### Accessing elements outside of the component's host element

There are times when a component harness might need to access elements outside of its corresponding component's host element. For example, code that displays a floating element or pop-up often attaches DOM elements directly to the document body, such as the `Overlay` service in Angular CDK.

In this case, `ComponentHarness` provides a method that can be used to get a `LocatorFactory` for the root element of the document. The `LocatorFactory` supports most of the same APIs as the `ComponentHarness` base class, and can then be used to query relative to the document's root element.

Consider if the `MyPopup` component above used the CDK overlay for the popup content, rather than an element in its own template. In this case, `MyPopupHarness` would have to access the content element via `documentRootLocatorFactory()` method that gets a locator factory rooted at the document root.

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';

/\*_ Gets a `HarnessLoader` whose root element is the popup's content element. _/
async getHarnessLoaderForContent(): Promise<HarnessLoader> {
const rootLocator = this.documentRootLocatorFactory();
return rootLocator.harnessLoaderFor('my-popup-content');
}
}
</docs-code>

### Waiting for asynchronous tasks

The methods on `TestElement` automatically trigger Angular's change detection and wait for tasks inside the `NgZone`. In most cases no special effort is required for harness authors to wait on asynchronous tasks. However, there are some edge cases where this may not be sufficient.

Under some circumstances, Angular animations may require a second cycle of change detection and subsequent `NgZone` stabilization before animation events are fully flushed. In cases where this is needed, the `ComponentHarness` offers a `forceStabilize()` method that can be called to do the second round.

You can use `NgZone.runOutsideAngular()` to schedule tasks outside of NgZone. Call the `waitForTasksOutsideAngular()` method on the corresponding harness if you need to explicitly wait for tasks outside `NgZone` since this does not happen automatically.

## Debugging tests

If your tests aren't working as you expect them to, you can inspect and debug them in the browser.

Debug specs in the browser in the same way that you debug an application.

1. Reveal the Karma browser window.
    See [Set up testing](guide/testing#set-up-testing) if you need help with this step.

1. Click the **DEBUG** button to open a new browser tab and re-run the tests.
1. Open the browser's **Developer Tools**. On Windows, press `Ctrl-Shift-I`. On macOS, press `Command-Option-I`.
1. Pick the **Sources** section.
1. Press `Control/Command-P`, and then start typing the name of your test file to open it.
1. Set a breakpoint in the test.
1. Refresh the browser, and notice how it stops at the breakpoint.

(From experimental-unit-test.md)

## Experimental unit testing system

The Angular CLI provides an experimental unit test system that can use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as a test runner.

IMPORTANT: This experimental unit testing system requires the use of the `application` build system.
The `application` build system is the default for all newly created projects.

### Set up testing

The Angular CLI includes the test system within a new project but must be configured before it can be used.

The project you create with the CLI is setup to use the `karma` test system by default.
To change to the experimental unit test system, update the `test` target as follows:

<docs-code language="json">
"test": {
  "builder": "@angular/build:unit-test",
  "options": {
    "tsConfig": "tsconfig.spec.json",
    "runner": "vitest",
    "buildTarget": "::development",
  }
}
</docs-code>

The `buildTarget` operates similarly to the option available to the development server.
The `build` target configures build options for the tests.
If the `development` build configuration is missing for a project or you need
different options for testing, you can create and use a `testing` or similarly named build configuration.

To execute the application's testing, just run the [`ng test`](cli/test) CLI command as before:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng test

</docs-code>

The `ng test` command builds the application in *watch mode*, and launches the configured runner.

The console output looks like below:

<docs-code language="shell">
 âœ“ spec-app-app.spec.js (2 tests) 31ms
   âœ“ App > should create the app 22ms
   âœ“ App > should render title 8ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  2 passed (2)
   Start at  14:24:15
   Duration  1.16s (transform 628ms, setup 703ms, collect 64ms, tests 31ms, environment 188ms, prepare 33ms)
</docs-code>

Watch mode is enabled by default when using an interactive terminal and not running on CI.

### Configuration

The Angular CLI takes care of the Vitest configuration for you. It constructs the full configuration in memory, based on options specified in the `angular.json` file.
Directly customizing the underlying test runner configuration is currently not supported.

### Bug reports

Report issues and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues).

Please provide a minimal reproduction where possible to aid the team in addressing issues.

(From overview.md)

## Testing

Testing your Angular application helps you check that your application is working as you expect.

### Set up testing

The Angular CLI downloads and installs everything you need to test an Angular application with [Jasmine testing framework](https://jasmine.github.io).

The project you create with the CLI is immediately ready to test.
Just run the [`ng test`](cli/test) CLI command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng test

</docs-code>

The `ng test` command builds the application in *watch mode*,
and launches the [Karma test runner](https://karma-runner.github.io).

The console output looks like below:

<docs-code language="shell">

02 11 2022 09:08:28.605:INFO [karma-server]: Karma v6.4.1 server started at http://localhost:9876/
02 11 2022 09:08:28.607:INFO [launcher]: Launching browsers Chrome with concurrency unlimited
02 11 2022 09:08:28.620:INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
02 11 2022 09:08:31.312:INFO [Chrome]: Connected on socket -LaEYvD2R7MdcS0-AAAB with id 31534482
Chrome: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (0.193 secs / 0.172 secs)
TOTAL: 3 SUCCESS

</docs-code>

The last line of the log shows that Karma ran three tests that all passed.

The test output is displayed in the browser using [Karma Jasmine HTML Reporter](https://github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter).

<img alt="Jasmine HTML Reporter in the browser" src="assets/images/guide/testing/initial-jasmine-html-reporter.png">

Click on a test row to re-run just that test or click on a description to re-run the tests in the selected test group \("test suite"\).

Meanwhile, the `ng test` command is watching for changes.

To see this in action, make a small change to `app.component.ts` and save.
The tests run again, the browser refreshes, and the new test results appear.

### Configuration

The Angular CLI takes care of Jasmine and Karma configuration for you. It constructs the full configuration in memory, based on options specified in the `angular.json` file.

If you want to customize Karma, you can create a `karma.conf.js` by running the following command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng generate config karma

</docs-code>

HELPFUL: Read more about Karma configuration in the [Karma configuration guide](http://karma-runner.github.io/6.4/config/configuration-file.html).

#### Other test frameworks

You can also unit test an Angular application with other testing libraries and test runners.
Each library and runner has its own distinctive installation procedures, configuration, and syntax.

#### Test file name and location

Inside the `src/app` folder the Angular CLI generated a test file for the `AppComponent` named `app.component.spec.ts`.

IMPORTANT: The test file extension **must be `.spec.ts`** so that tooling can identify it as a file with tests \(also known as a *spec* file\).

The `app.component.ts` and `app.component.spec.ts` files are siblings in the same folder.
The root file names \(`app.component`\) are the same for both files.

Adopt these two conventions in your own projects for *every kind* of test file.

##### Place your spec file next to the file it tests

It's a good idea to put unit test spec files in the same folder
as the application source code files that they test:

* Such tests are painless to find
* You see at a glance if a part of your application lacks tests
* Nearby tests can reveal how a part works in context
* When you move the source \(inevitable\), you remember to move the test
* When you rename the source file \(inevitable\), you remember to rename the test file

##### Place your spec files in a test folder

Application integration specs can test the interactions of multiple parts
spread across folders and modules.
They don't really belong to any part in particular, so they don't have a
natural home next to any one file.

It's often better to create an appropriate folder for them in the `tests` directory.

Of course specs that test the test helpers belong in the `test` folder,
next to their corresponding helper files.

### Testing in continuous integration

One of the best ways to keep your project bug-free is through a test suite, but you might forget to run tests all the time.

Continuous integration \(CI\) servers let you set up your project repository so that your tests run on every commit and pull request.

To test your Angular CLI application in Continuous integration \(CI\) run the following command:

<docs-code language="shell">
ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadless
</docs-code>

After you've set up your application for testing, you might find the following testing guides useful.

(From pipes.md)

## Testing Pipes

You can test [pipes](guide/templates/pipes) without the Angular testing utilities.

### Testing the `TitleCasePipe`

A pipe class has one method, `transform`, that manipulates the input value into a transformed output value.
The `transform` implementation rarely interacts with the DOM.
Most pipes have no dependence on Angular other than the `@Pipe` metadata and an interface.

Consider a `TitleCasePipe` that capitalizes the first letter of each word.
Here's an implementation with a regular expression.

<docs-code header="app/shared/title-case.pipe.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/title-case.pipe.ts"/>

Anything that uses a regular expression is worth testing thoroughly.
Use simple Jasmine to explore the expected cases and the edge cases.

<docs-code header="app/shared/title-case.pipe.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/title-case.pipe.spec.ts" visibleRegion="excerpt"/>

### Writing DOM tests to support a pipe test

These are tests of the pipe *in isolation*.
They can't tell if the `TitleCasePipe` is working properly as applied in the application components.

Consider adding component tests such as this one:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (pipe test)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="title-case-pipe"/>

---


(From services.md)

## Testing services

To check that your services are working as you intend, you can write tests specifically for them.

Services are often the smoothest files to unit test.
Here are some synchronous and asynchronous unit tests of the `ValueService` written without assistance from Angular testing utilities.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="ValueService"/>

### Services with dependencies

Services often depend on other services that Angular injects into the constructor.
In many cases, you can create and *inject* these dependencies by hand while calling the service's constructor.

The `MasterService` is a simple example:

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.ts" visibleRegion="MasterService"/>

`MasterService` delegates its only method, `getValue`, to the injected `ValueService`.

Here are several ways to test it.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="MasterService"/>

The first test creates a `ValueService` with `new` and passes it to the `MasterService` constructor.

However, injecting the real service rarely works well as most dependent services are difficult to create and control.

Instead, mock the dependency, use a dummy value, or create a [spy](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite#section-Spies) on the pertinent service method.

HELPFUL: Prefer spies as they are usually the best way to mock services.

These standard testing techniques are great for unit testing services in isolation.

However, you almost always inject services into application classes using Angular dependency injection and you should have tests that reflect that usage pattern.
Angular testing utilities make it straightforward to investigate how injected services behave.

### Testing services with the `TestBed`

Your application relies on Angular [dependency injection (DI)](guide/di) to create services.
When a service has a dependent service, DI finds or creates that dependent service.
And if that dependent service has its own dependencies, DI finds-or-creates them as well.

As a service *consumer*, you don't worry about any of this.
You don't worry about the order of constructor arguments or how they're created.

As a service *tester*, you must at least think about the first level of service dependencies but you *can* let Angular DI do the service creation and deal with constructor argument order when you use the `TestBed` testing utility to provide and create services.

### Angular `TestBed`

The `TestBed` is the most important of the Angular testing utilities.
The `TestBed` creates a dynamically-constructed Angular *test* module that emulates an Angular [@NgModule](guide/ngmodules).

The `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` method takes a metadata object that can have most of the properties of an [@NgModule](guide/ngmodules).

To test a service, you set the `providers` metadata property with an array of the services that you'll test or mock.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts (provide ValueService in beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="value-service-before-each"/>

Then inject it inside a test by calling `TestBed.inject()` with the service class as the argument.

HELPFUL: `TestBed.get()` was deprecated as of Angular version 9.
To help minimize breaking changes, Angular introduces a new function called `TestBed.inject()`, which you should use instead.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="value-service-inject-it"/>

Or inside the `beforeEach()` if you prefer to inject the service as part of your setup.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="value-service-inject-before-each"> </docs-code>

When testing a service with a dependency, provide the mock in the `providers` array.

In the following example, the mock is a spy object.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="master-service-before-each"/>

The test consumes that spy in the same way it did earlier.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="master-service-it"/>

### Testing without `beforeEach()`

Most test suites in this guide call `beforeEach()` to set the preconditions for each `it()` test and rely on the `TestBed` to create classes and inject services.

There's another school of testing that never calls `beforeEach()` and prefers to create classes explicitly rather than use the `TestBed`.

Here's how you might rewrite one of the `MasterService` tests in that style.

Begin by putting re-usable, preparatory code in a *setup* function instead of `beforeEach()`.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-before-each-setup"/>

The `setup()` function returns an object literal with the variables, such as `masterService`, that a test might reference.
You don't define *semi-global* variables \(for example, `let masterService: MasterService`\) in the body of the `describe()`.

Then each test invokes `setup()` in its first line, before continuing with steps that manipulate the test subject and assert expectations.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-before-each-test"/>

Notice how the test uses [*destructuring assignment*](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to extract the setup variables that it needs.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-before-each-setup-call"/>

Many developers feel this approach is cleaner and more explicit than the traditional `beforeEach()` style.

Although this testing guide follows the traditional style and the default [CLI schematics](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) generate test files with `beforeEach()` and `TestBed`, feel free to adopt *this alternative approach* in your own projects.

### Testing HTTP services

Data services that make HTTP calls to remote servers typically inject and delegate to the Angular [`HttpClient`](guide/http/testing) service for XHR calls.

You can test a data service with an injected `HttpClient` spy as you would test any service with a dependency.

<docs-code header="app/model/hero.service.spec.ts (tests with spies)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/model/hero.service.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-with-spies"/>

IMPORTANT: The `HeroService` methods return `Observables`.
You must *subscribe* to an observable to \(a\) cause it to execute and \(b\) assert that the method succeeds or fails.

The `subscribe()` method takes a success \(`next`\) and fail \(`error`\) callback.
Make sure you provide *both* callbacks so that you capture errors.
Neglecting to do so produces an asynchronous uncaught observable error that the test runner will likely attribute to a completely different test.

### `HttpClientTestingModule`

Extended interactions between a data service and the `HttpClient` can be complex and difficult to mock with spies.

The `HttpClientTestingModule` can make these testing scenarios more manageable.

While the *code sample* accompanying this guide demonstrates `HttpClientTestingModule`, this page defers to the [Http guide](guide/http/testing), which covers testing with the `HttpClientTestingModule` in detail.

(From using-component-harnesses.md)

## Using component harnesses in tests

### Before you start

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [component harnesses overview guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-overview). Read that first if you're new to using component harnesses.

#### CDK Installation

The [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.dev/cdk/categories) is a set of behavior primitives for building components. To use the component harnesses, first install `@angular/cdk` from npm. You can do this from your terminal using the Angular CLI:

<docs-code language="shell">
  ng add @angular/cdk
</docs-code>

### Test harness environments and loaders

You can use component test harnesses in different test environments. Angular CDK supports two built-in environments:

- Unit tests with Angular's `TestBed`
- End-to-end tests with [WebDriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver)

Each environment provides a <strong>harness loader</strong>. The loader creates the harness instances you use throughout your tests. See below for more specific guidance on supported testing environments.

Additional testing environments require custom bindings. See the [adding harness support for additional testing environments guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-testing-environments) for more information.

#### Using the loader from `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` for unit tests

For unit tests you can create a harness loader from [TestbedHarnessEnvironment](/api/cdk/testing/TestbedHarnessEnvironment). This environment uses a [component fixture](api/core/testing/ComponentFixture) created by Angular's `TestBed`.

To create a harness loader rooted at the fixture's root element, use the `loader()` method:

<docs-code language="typescript">
const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);

// Create a harness loader from the fixture
const loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);
...

// Use the loader to get harness instances
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);
</docs-code>

To create a harness loader for harnesses for elements that fall outside the fixture, use the `documentRootLoader()` method. For example, code that displays a floating element or pop-up often attaches DOM elements directly to the document body, such as the `Overlay` service in Angular CDK.

You can also create a harness loader directly with `harnessForFixture()` for a harness at that fixture's root element directly.

#### Using the loader from `SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment` for end-to-end tests

For WebDriver-based end-to-end tests you can create a harness loader with `SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment`.

Use the `loader()` method to get the harness loader instance for the current HTML document, rooted at the document's root element. This environment uses a WebDriver client.

<docs-code language="typescript">
let wd: webdriver.WebDriver = getMyWebDriverClient();
const loader = SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment.loader(wd);
...
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);
</docs-code>

### Using a harness loader

Harness loader instances correspond to a specific DOM element and are used to create component harness instances for elements under that specific element.

To get `ComponentHarness` for the first instance of the element, use the `getHarness()` method. To get all `ComponentHarness` instances, use the `getAllHarnesses()` method.

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Get harness for first instance of the element
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);

// Get harnesses for all instances of the element
const myComponentHarnesses = await loader.getHarnesses(MyComponent);
</docs-code>

As an example, consider a reusable dialog-button component that opens a dialog on click. It contains the following components, each with a corresponding harness:

- `MyDialogButton` (composes the `MyButton` and `MyDialog` with a convenient API)
- `MyButton` (a standard button component)
- `MyDialog` (a dialog appended to `document.body` by `MyDialogButton` upon click)

The following test loads harnesses for each of these components:

<docs-code language="typescript">
let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;
let loader: HarnessLoader;
let rootLoader: HarnessLoader;

beforeEach(() => {
fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);
loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);
rootLoader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.documentRootLoader(fixture);
});

it('loads harnesses', async () => {
// Load a harness for the bootstrapped component with `harnessForFixture`
dialogButtonHarness =
await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixture(fixture, MyDialogButtonHarness);
// The button element is inside the fixture's root element, so we use `loader`.
const buttonHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);
// Click the button to open the dialog
await buttonHarness.click();
// The dialog is appended to `document.body`, outside of the fixture's root element,
// so we use `rootLoader` in this case.
const dialogHarness = await rootLoader.getHarness(MyDialogHarness);
// ... make some assertions
});
</docs-code>

#### Harness behavior in different environments

Harnesses may not behave exactly the same in all environments. Some differences are unavoidable between the real user interaction versus the simulated events generated in unit tests. Angular CDK makes a best effort to normalize the behavior to the extent possible.

#### Interacting with child elements

To interact with elements below the root element of this harness loader, use the `HarnessLoader` instance of a child element. For the first instance of the child element, use the `getChildLoader()` method. For all instances of the child element, use the `getAllChildLoaders()` method.

<docs-code language="typescript">
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);

// Get loader for first instance of child element with '.child' selector
const childLoader = await myComponentHarness.getLoader('.child');

// Get loaders for all instances of child elements with '.child' selector
const allChildLoaders = await myComponentHarness.getAllChildLoaders('.child');
</docs-code>

#### Filtering harnesses

When a page contains multiple instances of a particular component, you may want to filter based on some property of the component to get a particular component instance. You can use a <strong>harness predicate</strong>, a class used to associate a `ComponentHarness` class with predicates functions that can be used to filter component instances, to do so.

When you ask a `HarnessLoader` for a harness, you're actually providing a HarnessQuery. A query can be one of two things:

- A harness constructor. This just gets that harness
- A `HarnessPredicate`, which gets harnesses that are filtered based on one or more conditions

`HarnessPredicate` does support some base filters (selector, ancestor) that work on anything that extends `ComponentHarness`.

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Example of loading a MyButtonComponentHarness with a harness predicate
const disabledButtonPredicate = new HarnessPredicate(MyButtonComponentHarness, {selector: '[disabled]'});
const disabledButton = await loader.getHarness(disabledButtonPredicate);
</docs-code>

However it's common for harnesses to implement a static `with()` method that accepts component-specific filtering options and returns a `HarnessPredicate`.

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Example of loading a MyButtonComponentHarness with a specific selector
const button = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonComponentHarness.with({selector: 'btn'}))
</docs-code>

For more details refer to the specific harness documentation since additional filtering options are specific to each harness implementation.

### Using test harness APIs

While every harness defines an API specific to its corresponding component, they all share a common base class, [ComponentHarness](/api/cdk/testing/ComponentHarness). This base class defines a static property, `hostSelector`, that matches the harness class to instances of the component in the DOM.

Beyond that, the API of any given harness is specific to its corresponding component; refer to the component's documentation to learn how to use a specific harness.

As an example, the following is a test for a component that uses the [Angular Material slider component harness](https://material.angular.dev/components/slider/api#MatSliderHarness):

<docs-code language="typescript">
it('should get value of slider thumb', async () => {
    const slider = await loader.getHarness(MatSliderHarness);
    const thumb = await slider.getEndThumb();
    expect(await thumb.getValue()).toBe(50);
});
</docs-code>

### Interop with Angular change detection

By default, test harnesses runs Angular's [change detection](https://angular.dev/best-practices/runtime-performance) before reading the state of a DOM element and after interacting with a DOM element.

There may be times that you need finer-grained control over change detection in your tests. such as checking the state of a component while an async operation is pending. In these cases use the `manualChangeDetection` function to disable automatic handling of change detection for a block of code.

<docs-code language="typescript">
it('checks state while async action is in progress', async () => {
  const buttonHarness = loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);
  await manualChangeDetection(async () => {
    await buttonHarness.click();
    fixture.detectChanges();
    // Check expectations while async click operation is in progress.
    expect(isProgressSpinnerVisible()).toBe(true);
    await fixture.whenStable();
    // Check expectations after async click operation complete.
    expect(isProgressSpinnerVisible()).toBe(false);
  });
});
</docs-code>

Almost all harness methods are asynchronous and return a `Promise` to support the following:

- Support for unit tests
- Support for end-to-end tests
- Insulate tests against changes in asynchronous behavior

The Angular team recommends using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) to improve the test readability. Calling `await` blocks the execution of your test until the associated `Promise` resolves.

Occasionally, you may want to perform multiple actions simultaneously and wait until they're all done rather than performing each action sequentially. For example, read multiple properties of a single component. In these situations use the `parallel` function to parallelize the operations. The parallel function works similarly to `Promise.all`, while also optimizing change detection checks.

<docs-code language="typescript">
it('reads properties in parallel', async () => {
  const checkboxHarness = loader.getHarness(MyCheckboxHarness);
  // Read the checked and intermediate properties simultaneously.
  const [checked, indeterminate] = await parallel(() => [
    checkboxHarness.isChecked(),
    checkboxHarness.isIndeterminate()
  ]);
  expect(checked).toBe(false);
  expect(indeterminate).toBe(true);
});
</docs-code>

## Testing Utility APIs

This page describes the most useful Angular testing features.

The Angular testing utilities include the `TestBed`, the `ComponentFixture`, and a handful of functions that control the test environment.
The [`TestBed`](#testbed-api-summary) and [`ComponentFixture`](#component-fixture-api-summary) classes are covered separately.

Here's a summary of the stand-alone functions, in order of likely utility:

| Function                     | Details |
|:---                          |:---     |
| `waitForAsync`               | Runs the body of a test \(`it`\) or setup \(`beforeEach`\) function within a special *async test zone*. See [waitForAsync](guide/testing/components-scenarios#waitForAsync).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `fakeAsync`                  | Runs the body of a test \(`it`\) within a special *fakeAsync test zone*, enabling a linear control flow coding style. See [fakeAsync](guide/testing/components-scenarios#fake-async).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tick`                       | Simulates the passage of time and the completion of pending asynchronous activities by flushing both *timer* and *micro-task* queues within the *fakeAsync test zone*.  The curious, dedicated reader might enjoy this lengthy blog post, ["*Tasks, microtasks, queues and schedules*"](https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules).  Accepts an optional argument that moves the virtual clock forward by the specified number of milliseconds, clearing asynchronous activities scheduled within that timeframe. See [tick](guide/testing/components-scenarios#tick). |
| `inject`                     | Injects one or more services from the current `TestBed` injector into a test function. It cannot inject a service provided by the component itself. See discussion of the [debugElement.injector](guide/testing/components-scenarios#get-injected-services).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `discardPeriodicTasks`       | When a `fakeAsync()` test ends with pending timer event *tasks* \(queued `setTimeOut` and `setInterval` callbacks\), the test fails with a clear error message. <br /> In general, a test should end with no queued tasks. When pending timer tasks are expected, call `discardPeriodicTasks` to flush the *task* queue and avoid the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `flushMicrotasks`            | When a `fakeAsync()` test ends with pending *micro-tasks* such as unresolved promises, the test fails with a clear error message. <br /> In general, a test should wait for micro-tasks to finish. When pending microtasks are expected, call `flushMicrotasks` to flush the  *micro-task* queue and avoid the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `ComponentFixtureAutoDetect` | A provider token for a service that turns on [automatic change detection](guide/testing/components-scenarios#automatic-change-detection).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `getTestBed`                 | Gets the current instance of the `TestBed`. Usually unnecessary because the static class methods of the `TestBed` class are typically sufficient. The `TestBed` instance exposes a few rarely used members that are not available as static methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### `TestBed` class summary

The `TestBed` class is one of the principal Angular testing utilities.
Its API is quite large and can be overwhelming until you've explored it, a little at a time.
Read the early part of this guide first to get the basics before trying to absorb the full API.

The module definition passed to `configureTestingModule` is a subset of the `@NgModule` metadata properties.

<docs-code language="javascript">

type TestModuleMetadata = {
  providers?: any[];
  declarations?: any[];
  imports?: any[];
  schemas?: Array<SchemaMetadata | any[]>;
};

</docs-code>

Each override method takes a `MetadataOverride<T>` where `T` is the kind of metadata appropriate to the method, that is, the parameter of an `@NgModule`, `@Component`, `@Directive`, or `@Pipe`.

<docs-code language="javascript">

type MetadataOverride<T> = {
  add?: Partial<T>;
  remove?: Partial<T>;
  set?: Partial<T>;
};

</docs-code>

The `TestBed` API consists of static class methods that either update or reference a *global* instance of the `TestBed`.

Internally, all static methods cover methods of the current runtime `TestBed` instance, which is also returned by the `getTestBed()` function.

Call `TestBed` methods *within* a `beforeEach()` to ensure a fresh start before each individual test.

Here are the most important static methods, in order of likely utility.

| Methods                                                        | Details |
|:---                                                            |:---     |
| `configureTestingModule`                                       | The testing shims \(`karma-test-shim`, `browser-test-shim`\) establish the [initial test environment](guide/testing) and a default testing module. The default testing module is configured with basic declaratives and some Angular service substitutes that every tester needs. <br /> Call `configureTestingModule` to refine the testing module configuration for a particular set of tests by adding and removing imports, declarations \(of components, directives, and pipes\), and providers.                                                                                                                                              |
| `compileComponents`                                            | Compile the testing module asynchronously after you've finished configuring it. You **must** call this method if *any* of the testing module components have a `templateUrl` or `styleUrls` because fetching component template and style files is necessarily asynchronous. See [compileComponents](guide/testing/components-scenarios#calling-compilecomponents). <br /> After calling `compileComponents`, the `TestBed` configuration is frozen for the duration of the current spec.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `createComponent<T>`                                     | Create an instance of a component of type `T` based on the current `TestBed` configuration. After calling `createComponent`, the `TestBed` configuration is frozen for the duration of the current spec.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `overrideModule`                                               | Replace metadata for the given `NgModule`. Recall that modules can import other modules. The `overrideModule` method can reach deeply into the current testing module to modify one of these inner modules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `overrideComponent`                                            | Replace metadata for the given component class, which could be nested deeply within an inner module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `overrideDirective`                                            | Replace metadata for the given directive class, which could be nested deeply within an inner module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `overridePipe`                                                 | Replace metadata for the given pipe class, which could be nested deeply within an inner module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

 `inject`                           | Retrieve a service from the current `TestBed` injector. The `inject` function is often adequate for this purpose. But `inject` throws an error if it can't provide the service. <br /> What if the service is optional? <br /> The `TestBed.inject()` method takes an optional second parameter, the object to return if Angular can't find the provider \(`null` in this example\): <docs-code header="app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="testbed-get-w-null"/> After calling `TestBed.inject`, the `TestBed` configuration is frozen for the duration of the current spec. |
|
 `initTestEnvironment` | Initialize the testing environment for the entire test run. <br /> The testing shims \(`karma-test-shim`, `browser-test-shim`\) call it for you so there is rarely a reason for you to call it yourself. <br /> Call this method *exactly once*. To change this default in the middle of a test run, call `resetTestEnvironment` first. <br /> Specify the Angular compiler factory, a `PlatformRef`, and a default Angular testing module. Alternatives for non-browser platforms are available in the general form `@angular/platform-<platform_name>/testing/<platform_name>`.                                                                  |
| `resetTestEnvironment`                                         | Reset the initial test environment, including the default testing module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

A few of the `TestBed` instance methods are not covered by static `TestBed` *class* methods.
These are rarely needed.

### The `ComponentFixture`

The `TestBed.createComponent<T>` creates an instance of the component `T` and returns a strongly typed `ComponentFixture` for that component.

The `ComponentFixture` properties and methods provide access to the component, its DOM representation, and aspects of its Angular environment.

#### `ComponentFixture` properties

Here are the most important properties for testers, in order of likely utility.

| Properties          | Details |
|:---                 |:---     |
| `componentInstance` | The instance of the component class created by `TestBed.createComponent`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `debugElement`      | The `DebugElement` associated with the root element of the component. <br /> The `debugElement` provides insight into the component and its DOM element during test and debugging. It's a critical property for testers. The most interesting members are covered [below](#debug-element-details). |
| `nativeElement`     | The native DOM element at the root of the component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `changeDetectorRef` | The `ChangeDetectorRef` for the component. <br /> The `ChangeDetectorRef` is most valuable when testing a component that has the `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` method or the component's change detection is under your programmatic control.                                                   |

#### `ComponentFixture` methods

The *fixture* methods cause Angular to perform certain tasks on the component tree.
Call these method to trigger Angular behavior in response to simulated user action.

Here are the most useful methods for testers.

| Methods             | Details |
|:---                 |:---     |
| `detectChanges`     | Trigger a change detection cycle for the component. <br /> Call it to initialize the component \(it calls `ngOnInit`\) and after your test code, change the component's data bound property values. Angular can't see that you've changed `personComponent.name` and won't update the `name` binding until you call `detectChanges`. <br /> Runs `checkNoChanges` afterwards to confirm that there are no circular updates unless called as `detectChanges(false)`;                                                                                    |
| `autoDetectChanges` | Set this to `true` when you want the fixture to detect changes automatically. <br /> When autodetect is `true`, the test fixture calls `detectChanges` immediately after creating the component. Then it listens for pertinent zone events and calls `detectChanges` accordingly. When your test code modifies component property values directly, you probably still have to call `fixture.detectChanges` to trigger data binding updates. <br /> The default is `false`. Testers who prefer fine control over test behavior tend to keep it `false`. |
| `checkNoChanges`    | Do a change detection run to make sure there are no pending changes. Throws an exceptions if there are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `isStable`          | If the fixture is currently *stable*, returns `true`. If there are async tasks that have not completed, returns `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `whenStable`        | Returns a promise that resolves when the fixture is stable. <br /> To resume testing after completion of asynchronous activity or asynchronous change detection, hook that promise. See [whenStable](guide/testing/components-scenarios#whenstable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `destroy`           | Trigger component destruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

##### `DebugElement`

The `DebugElement` provides crucial insights into the component's DOM representation.

From the test root component's `DebugElement` returned by `fixture.debugElement`, you can walk \(and query\) the fixture's entire element and component subtrees.

Here are the most useful `DebugElement` members for testers, in approximate order of utility:

| Members               | Details |
|:---                   |:---     |
| `nativeElement`       | The corresponding DOM element in the browser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `query`               | Calling `query(predicate: Predicate<DebugElement>)` returns the first `DebugElement` that matches the [predicate](#query-predicate) at any depth in the subtree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `queryAll`            | Calling `queryAll(predicate: Predicate<DebugElement>)` returns all `DebugElements` that matches the [predicate](#query-predicate) at any depth in subtree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `injector`            | The host dependency injector. For example, the root element's component instance injector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `componentInstance`   | The element's own component instance, if it has one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `context`             | An object that provides parent context for this element. Often an ancestor component instance that governs this element. <br /> When an element is repeated within `*ngFor`, the context is an `NgForOf` whose `$implicit` property is the value of the row instance value. For example, the `hero` in `*ngFor="let hero of heroes"`.                                                                   |
| `children`            | The immediate `DebugElement` children. Walk the tree by descending through `children`.  `DebugElement` also has `childNodes`, a list of `DebugNode` objects. `DebugElement` derives from `DebugNode` objects and there are often more nodes than elements. Testers can usually ignore plain nodes.                                                                  |
| `parent`              | The `DebugElement` parent. Null if this is the root element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `name`                | The element tag name, if it is an element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `triggerEventHandler` | Triggers the event by its name if there is a corresponding listener in the element's `listeners` collection. The second parameter is the *event object* expected by the handler. See [triggerEventHandler](guide/testing/components-scenarios#trigger-event-handler). <br /> If the event lacks a listener or there's some other problem, consider calling `nativeElement.dispatchEvent(eventObject)`. |
| `listeners`           | The callbacks attached to the component's `@Output` properties and/or the element's event properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `providerTokens`      | This component's injector lookup tokens.

The `DebugElement.query(predicate)` and `DebugElement.queryAll(predicate)` methods take a predicate that filters the source element's subtree for matching `DebugElement`.

The predicate is any method that takes a `DebugElement` and returns a *truthy* value.
The following example finds all `DebugElements` with a reference to a template local variable named "content":

The Angular `By` class has three static methods for common predicates:

| Static method             | Details |
|:---                       |:---     |
| `By.all`                  | Return all elements                                                        |
| `By.css(selector)`        | Return elements with matching CSS selectors                                |
| `By.directive(directive)` | Return elements that Angular matched to an instance of the directive class |
