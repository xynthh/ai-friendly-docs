# AI-Friendly Angular Documentation Generator

## Feature Type

Data Transformation Feature (following the Data Transformation Blueprint)

## Purpose and Scope

This feature is responsible for generating AI-friendly Angular documentation by transforming and organizing content from multiple source files into a structured set of markdown files. It processes various sections of Angular documentation according to specific rules for different documentation types to optimize content for AI consumption.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Consolidate various sections of Angular documentation into structured markdown files
- Create individual section files for different documentation areas
- Generate a single comprehensive file containing all documentation
- Generate a table of contents file for easy navigation
- Support different consolidation strategies based on documentation section type

### Non-functional Requirements

- Process a large number of markdown files efficiently
- Maintain heading hierarchy in consolidated documents
- Preserve content structure from original documentation
- Provide clear logging for the consolidation process

## Technical Design

The feature follows a modular design with specialized functions for different aspects of the consolidation process:

- Directory and file finding utilities to locate source documentation
- Consolidation utilities that combine multiple files into a single document
- File processing utilities for transforming content
- Table of contents generation
- Individual section processors for different types of Angular documentation

The consolidation process:

1. Cleans and creates the target directory structure
2. Processes each documentation section based on its type
3. Generates a combined file with all documentation
4. Creates a table of contents file

## Dependencies

This feature depends on:

- Node.js file system module for file operations
- Path module for path manipulation

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual transformation functions
- Integration tests for the complete consolidation process
- Validation tests to ensure output files are properly formatted
- Edge case tests for handling missing files or directories
